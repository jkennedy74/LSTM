EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSE SHOT
We see a close view of a roof parapet and the curved rail of 
a fire escape. In the bag, are large skyscrapers with all 
their windows fully lit in the late winter afternoon. This 
background is used for the CREDIT TITLES of the picture. 
After the last card has FADED OUT, we HOLD on to the empty 
parapet, when suddenly a man's hand reaches and grips the 
top of the rail. It is followed by another hand and, after a 
beat, we see the face of a man in his early 30's. He is an 
Italian type, with rough features. He turns quickly and looks 
below him and then turning back, springs up over the empty 
parapet and is lost from view. We STAY on the EMPTY SCENE 
for a second or two as we HEAR the scraping of boots on the 
iron ladder. Someone else is coming up. Presently, two more 
hands and the head of a uniformed policeman with cap and 
badge starts to climb over the parapet. The CAMERA PULLS 
BACK so that by the time he has completed his climb, he is 
in full figure. He dashes out of the picture drawing his 
gun. Immediately following him over the parapet, a detective 
in plain clothes climbs over. This is JOHN FERGUSON, known 
as SCOTTIE. He too pulls a gun and dashes out of the picture.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT
A vast panorama of the San Francisco skyline. Nearer to us 
are three tiny figures running and jumping over the roof 
tops. The man on the run, whom we first saw climb over the 
parapet, is dressed in a white shirt and light tan linen 
slacks, and wearing sneakers. The uniformed man is shooting 
at him. Scottie is dressed in medium grey clothes. The CAMERA 
SLOWLY PANS the group across the roof tops.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - MED. SHOT
We now see a short gap between rooftops, with a drop below. 
The pursued man makes the leap successfully followed by the 
uniformed policeman. Scottie makes the same leap, but almost 
trips in taking off and is thrown off balance. He tries to 
recover, lands awkwardly on the opposite roof, and falls 
forward, prone, with a heavy impact that hurts and drives 
tile breath from his body. He tries to rise but raises his 
head with a look of pain -- one leg is doubled up under the 
other. The tiles give way, and he slides backwards, and his 
legs go over the edge of the roof, then his body. In his 
daze he grasps at the loose tiles, and as he goes over the 
edge he clutches on to the gutter, which gives way, and he 
swings off into space, looking down.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSE SHOT
Scottie looking down.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT
From Scottie's viewpoint, the gap beneath the building and 
the ground below. It seems to treble its depth.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSEUP
Scottie looking down with horror. His eyes close as a wave 
of nausea overcomes him.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT
In the distance the fleeing criminal. The policeman, seeing 
what has happened to Scottie, returns to the slope of the 
roof and strains to reach down to Scottie.
POLICEMAN
Give me your hand!
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSE UP
SCOTTIE'S HEAD. His hands grip the edge of the guttering. 
The tips of the fingers of policeman straining to reach 
Scottie, are at the top of screen. Scottie begins to open 
his grip but stares down, he quickly resumes his grip looking 
up hopelessly towards the helping hand. He looks down again. 
FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEWPOINT - the ground below still a long way 
away.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT
The policeman's hand in foreground, his face beyond.
POLICEMAN
What's the matter with you? Give me 
your hand!
Policeman endeavors to stretch out his hand further.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK)
The tiles beneath the policeman's heel begin to give. The 
Policeman starts to slide. He claws desperately at the surface 
of the roof.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSEUP
Scottie, his eyes closed. He opens them as he hears a wild 
cry.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT
The policeman falling through space.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSEUP
Scottie stares down in horror.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT
The body of the policeman sprawled on the ground below. 
People are running into the alleyway; they stare at the body, 
look up to where Scottie is hanging. We see the light on 
their upturned faces. And now we hear a police whistle blown 
shrilly, again and again. Up to this moment the background 
music has had an excitement to match the scene, and now it 
cuts off, abruptly, leaving on the echo of the police whistle 
as the DISSOLVE begins. Then, in the DISSOLVE, we hear the 
gentle insistence of Scarlatti played by a chamber orchestra.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. AN APARTMENT ON RUSSIAN HILL - (LATE AFTERNOON)
It is fresh, light, and simple, and crowded with books, 
phonograph records, pictures. The most striking feature of 
the apartment is the view: The rising hills of San Francisco 
framed by a large picture window. To one side of the window 
is the owner of the apartment, MAJORIE WOOD, called MIDGE, 
at a commercial drawing table concentrating with professional 
intensity on a drawing of a slim, a elongated woman with few 
features and fewer clothes. A brassiere sits on a table at 
Midge's elbow, and she studies it as she draws. Midge Wood 
is about thirty-seven, attractive, straight-forward, well-
but-simply-dressed; she wears glasses but does not whip them 
an and off as they do in the movies. The music comes from a 
gramophone. The other occupant of the room is Scottie. He 
sits in a big chair, with his feet stretched out on an ottoman 
and his head far back. There is a drink on a table nearby. 
He rouses himself to reach for it, and in doing so knocks 
over his walking stick that has been propped against the 
chair. He reaches out to catch it, and in the quickness of 
trying to keep it from falling, he wrenches his body around.
SCOTTIE
Ow!!
MIDGE
(Paying little 
attention)
I thought you said no more aches and 
pains?
SCOTTIE
It's this darned corset. It binds. 
He retrieves the stick.
MIDGE
No three-way stretch? How very un- 
chic.
SCOTTIE
Well, you know those police department 
doctors: no sense of style.
(Sighs gratefully)
Ah, tomorrow!
MIDGE
What's tomorrow?
SCOTTIE
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. 
And this thing goes out the window.
(He waves the stick)
I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle 
my behind... free and unconfined.
He raises his eyebrows with a surprised and gratified smile. 
Midge looks over at him with a grimace.
SCOTTIE
Midge, do you suppose many men wear 
corsets?
MIDGE
More than you think.
SCOTTIE
(Interested)
How do you know? Personal experience?
MIDGE
Please!
(Then, impersonally)
And what happens after tomorrow?
SCOTTIE
What do you mean?
MIDGE
What are you going to do? Now that 
you've quit the police force?
SCOTTIE
(Gently)
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
MIDGE
No, it's your life. But you were the 
bright young lawyer who decided he 
was going to be chief of police some 
day.
SCOTTIE
(Gently)
I had to quit, Midge.
MIDGE
Why?
SCOTTIE
I wake up at night seeing him fall 
from the roof... and try to reach 
out for him.
MIDGE
It wasn't your fault.
SCOTTIE
I know. Everybody tells me.
MIDGE
Johnny, the doctors explained --
SCOTTIE
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a 
disease. A fear of heights. And what 
a moment to find out I had it.
MIDGE
Well, you've got it. And there's no 
losing it. And there's no one to 
blame. So why quit?
SCOTTIE
And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
MIDGE
It's where you belong.
SCOTTIE
(With a grin)
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I 
dropped a pencil on the floor and 
bent down to pick it up, it could be 
disastrous!
MIDGE
(Laughs)
Ah, Johnny-O...
She considers him for a moment, then goes back to her work. 
By now he is up and wandering about with the help of the 
stick.
MIDGE
(Finally, as she works)
Well?... what'll you do?
SCOTTIE
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm 
a man of independent means. Or fairly 
independent.
MIDGE
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a 
while?
SCOTTIE
(Grins)
To forget? Don't be so motherly, 
Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
MIDGE
Have you had any dizzy spells this 
week?
SCOTTIE
I'm having one now.
She looks up sharply with quick apprehension.
SCOTTIE
From that music.
MIDGE
Oh!
She goes and turns off the gramophone. Scottie has wandered 
over to the drawing table.
SCOTTIE
What's this do-hickey here?
He turns the brassiere over with his stick
MIDGE
It's a brassiere. You know about 
those things. You're a big boy, now.
SCOTTIE
I've never run across one like that.
MIDGE
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. 
No shoulder straps, no back straps, 
but does everything a brassiere should 
do. It works on the principle of the 
cantilever bridge.
SCOTTIE
(Impressed)
Uh-huh!
MIDGE
An aircraft engineer down the 
peninsula designed it. He worked it 
out in his spare time.
SCOTTIE
What a pleasant hobby.
He wanders back to the chair and watches her work for a long 
moment. Then:
SCOTTIE
How's your love life, Midge?
MIDGE
That's following a train of thought.
SCOTTIE
Well?
MIDGE
Normal.
SCOTTIE
Aren't you ever going to get married?
MIDGE
(Lightly)
You know there's only one man in the 
world for me, Johnny-O.
SCOTTIE
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged 
once though, weren't we?
MIDGE
Three whole weeks.
SCOTTIE
Ah, sweet college days. But you're 
the one who blew it. I'm still 
available. Available Ferguson. Say, 
Midge, do you remember a guy at 
college named Gavin Elster?
MIDGE
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd 
would. No.
SCOTTIE
I got a call from him today. Funny. 
He dropped out of sight during the 
war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I 
guess he's back.
(he fishes out a slip 
of paper)
It's a Mission number.
MIDGE
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
SCOTTIE
Could be.
MIDGE
He's probably on the bum and wants 
to touch you for the price of a drink.
SCOTTIE
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a 
couple of drinks and tell him my 
troubles. But not tonight. If you 
won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, 
tonight.
(He rises to go)
MIDGE
Sorry, old man. Work.
SCOTTIE
Midge, what did you mean, there's no 
losing it?
MIDGE
What.
SCOTTIE
My... the acrophobia.
MIDGE
I asked my doctor. He said only 
another emotional shock could do it, 
and probably wouldn't. And you're 
not going to go diving off another 
rooftop to find out.
SCOTTIE
I think I can lick it.
MIDGE
How?
SCOTTIE
I've got a theory. Look. If I can 
get used to heights just a little at 
a time... progressively see?
He has been looking about eagerly, sees a low footstool, 
drags it to the center of the room as he speaks.
SCOTTIE
Here, I'll show you what I mean. 
We'll start with this.
MIDGE
That!?!
SCOTTIE
What do you want me to start with --
the Golden Gate Bridge?
He has stepped up on the footstool and stands there proudly 
looking up and down.
SCOTTIE
Now. I look up, I look down. I look 
up, I look down. Nothing to it.
MIDGE
(Overlapping)
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
She dashes to the kitchen, returns quickly with a small 
aluminum household ladder.
SCOTTIE
Ah, that's my girl! Here?
He steps on the first step.
MIDGE
Step number two.
SCOTTIE
Okay.
He gets up on the second step and goes through the routine.
SCOTTIE
I look up, I look down. I look up, I 
look down. I'm going to go right out 
and buy me a nice, tall stepladder. 
Here we go.
He gets on the top step.
MIDGE
Easy, now.
SCOTTIE
This is a cinch. I look up, I look 
down. I look up --
And at this moment he makes the mistake of turning and looking 
out through the picture window.
FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEWPOINT
We see the depth down to the street below the window. The 
whole picture begins to weave.
INT. MIDGE'S APARTMENT - (LATE AFTERNOON) - CLOSEUP
of Scottie -- expression of nausea.
FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEW POINT - LONG SHOT
The weaving view changes to the original scene where the 
ground receded in a rush and the body of the policeman fell 
into space.
INT. MIDGE'S APARTMENT - (LATE AFTERNOON) - MEDIUM CLOSE
SHOT
Scottie's face distorted with agony -- his eyes close and he 
begins to slump. CAMERA PULLS BACK SLIGHTLY as Midge now 
comes into shot, putting up her hands to him to hold him, 
and his weight is on her and his head is slumped, and the 
joke is over.
MIDGE
Johnny!
SCOTTIE
(Muttering, his face 
tight, his eyes shut)
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
DISSOLVE:
EXT. A SHIPYARD - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
Boats up an ways, men swarming over, cranes moving. At the 
gate, Scottie has paused to speak to the gateman. The gateman 
indicates a building in the distance, Scottie nods, goes 
past him, starts across the shipyard toward the building.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GAVIN ELSTER'S OFFICE - (DAY)
A well-appointed office with a large window looking out upon 
a busy shipyard. There are a couple of models of modern 
freighters in glass cases, but more important, on the walls 
are many framed prints and posters and maps relating to early 
California history; some from the Mexican days, many from 
the Gold Rush days, many of San Francisco in the Seventies 
and Eighties. Behind the desk sits Gavin Elster, a man about 
Scottie's age, huskily built, slightly balding, with cool, 
watchful eyes. He is beautifully tailored, and gives the 
sense of a man who relishes money and knows how to use it. 
He sits quietly watching Scottie, who stands staring out the 
window at the activity of the shipyard. After a long moment:
SCOTTIE
How'd you get into the shipbuilding 
business, Gavin?
ELSTER
I married into it.
Scottie shoots him a small surprised smile of approval at 
his frankness, then looks out the window again.
SCOTTIE
Interesting business.
ELSTER
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
SCOTTIE
You don't have to do it for a living.
ELSTER
No. But one assumes obligations. My 
wife's family is all gone; someone 
has to look after her interest. Her 
father's partner runs the company 
yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so 
I decided as long as I had to work 
at it, I'd come back here. I've always 
liked it here.
SCOTTIE
How long have you been back?
ELSTER
Almost a year.
SCOTTIE
And you like it.
ELSTER
San Francisco's changed. The things 
a that spell San Francisco to me are 
disappearing fast.
Scottie smiles at the old prints on the wall.
SCOTTIE
Like all this.
ELSTER
(Nodding)
I'd like to have lived here then. 
The color and excitement... the 
power... the freedom.
Though he does not stress the word, the way be lingers softly 
on the word "Freedom" makes Scottie look over at him again. 
Elster looks up and smiles companionably.
ELSTER
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
SCOTTIE
No, I'm all right.
ELSTER
I was sorry to read about that thing 
in the papers.
(No answer)
And you've quit the force.
(Scottie nods)
A permanent physical disability?
SCOTTIE
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling 
thing. It just means I can't climb 
steep stairs or go to high places, 
like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark.
But --
(Shrugs and smiles)
-- there are plenty of street-level 
bars In this town.
Elster considers the top of his desk for a moment, then looks 
up.
ELSTER
Would you like a drink now?
SCOTTIE
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the 
day for spirits.
(Pause)
Well, I guess that about covers 
everything, doesn't it? I never 
married; I don't see much of the 
"old college gang"; I'm a retired 
detective -- and you're in the 
shipbuilding business.
(Pause)
What's on your mind, Gavin?
A moment, then Elster rises from the desk casually, wanders 
across the room, looks out the window, gets out a handkerchief 
and blows his nose prosaically, finally turns and regards 
Scottie coolly and directly for a long moment.
ELSTER
I asked you to come up here, Scottie, 
knowing that you had quit detective 
works, but I wondered whether you 
would go back on the job -- as a 
special favor to me.
Scottie looks at him questioningly.
ELSTER
I want you to follow my wife.
Scottie does not change expression, and yet one can sense 
the feeling of anti-climax within him, and the almost 
imperceptible small cynical smile deep behind his eyes.
ELSTER
Not what you think. We're very happily 
married.
SCOTTIE
Then?
ELSTER
I'm afraid some harm may come to 
her.
SCOTTIE
From whom?
ELSTER
Someone dead.
Scottie waits.
ELSTER
Scottie, do you believe that someone 
out of the past, someone dead, can 
enter and take possession of a living 
being?
SCOTTIE
No.
ELSTER
If I told you I believe that his 
happened to my wife, what would you 
say?
SCOTTIE
I'd say you'd better take her to the 
nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, 
neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain 
family doctor. And have him check 
you both.
ELSTER
(Defeated)
Then you're of no use to me. I'm 
sorry I wasted your time. Thank you 
for coming in, Scottie.
Scottie rises to go, awkwardly, puzzled, a bit apologetic.
SCOTTIE
I didn't mean to be that rough.
ELSTER
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And 
you're still the hard-headed Scot, 
aren't you? Always were. Do you think 
I'm making it up?
SCOTTIE
No.
ELSTER
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't 
know how. She'll be talking to me 
about something, nothing at all, and 
suddenly the words fade into silence 
and a cloud comes into her eyes and 
they go blank... and she is somewhere 
else, away from me... someone I don't 
know. I call to her and she doesn't 
hear. And then with a long sigh she 
is back, and looks at me brightly, 
and doesn't know she's been away... 
can't tell me where... or why...
SCOTTIE
How often does this happen?
ELSTER
More and more in the past few weeks. 
And she wanders. God knows where she 
wanders. I followed her one day.
SCOTTIE
Where'd she go?
Elster almost ignores the question as he looks back to the 
day.
ELSTER
Watched her come out of the apartment, 
someone I didn't know... walking in 
a different way... holding her head 
in a way I didn't know; and get into 
her car, and drive out to...
(He smiles grimly)
Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She 
sat on a bench at the edge of the 
lake and stared across the water to 
the old pillars that stand an the 
far shore, the Portals of the Past. 
Sat there a long time, not moving... 
and I had to leave, to got to the 
office. That evening, when I came 
home, I asked what she'd done all 
day. She said she'd driven to Golden 
Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's 
all.
SCOTTIE
Well?
ELSTER
The speedometer of her car showed 
she had driven 94 miles that day. 
Where did she go?
(Pause)
I have to know, Scottie. Where she 
goes and what she does, before I got 
involved with doctors.
SCOTTIE
Have you talked to the doctors at 
all?
ELSTER
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know 
more before committing her to that 
kind of care.
(Anxiously)
Scottie --
SCOTTIE
(Quickly)
I can get you a firm of private eyes 
to follow her for you. They're 
dependable, good boys --
ELSTER
(Breaking in)
I want you.
SCOTTIE
It's not my line.
ELSTER
Scottie, I need a friend! Someone I 
can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
Long pause.
SCOTTIE
How can I see her, to know her?
ELSTER
We're going to an opening at the 
opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's 
first. Which is easier?
SCOTTIE
Ernie's.
ELSTER
All right.
(Pause)
You won't know what to look for at 
first, Scottie. Even I, who know her 
so well, cannot tell, sometimes, 
when the change has begun. She looks 
so lovely and normal...
The last part of this speech carries through the dissolve.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ERNIE'S RESTAURANT - (NIGHT)
We are in the upstairs room that, in mood and decor, takes 
us back to Bonanza Days. This is the way San Francisco was. 
Scottie is at the bar, turned a little so that he faces into 
the dining room, and as he drinks his eyes search the room 
slowly, carefully.
The CAMERA SEARCHES with him, passing over the many well-
dressed women, until it comes to rest on a table for two 
dressed against the far wall. Gavin Elster is seated there, 
dining with his wife. Scottie cannot get a clear look at 
her. She is turned slightly away from him, and when she does 
turn her head in his direction there always seems to be a 
waiter passing to block the view. And during all of this we 
hear Elster's voice, continuing from the previous scene.
ELSTER'S VOICE
But I realize now that the deep change 
began on the first day I brought her 
to San Francisco. You know what San 
Francisco does to people who have 
never seen it before. All of it 
happened to Madeleine, but with such 
an intensity as to be almost 
frightening. She was like a child 
came home. Everything about the city 
excited her: she had to walk all the 
hills, explore the edge of the ocean, 
see all the old houses and wander 
the old streets: and when she came 
upon something unchanged, something 
that was as it had been, her delight 
was so strong so fiercely possessive! 
These things were hers. And yet she 
had never been here before. She had 
been born and raised in the East. I 
liked it at first, of course. I love 
this place; I wanted my bride to 
love it. But then it began to make 
me uneasy. Her delight was too 
strong; her excitement was too 
intense, it never faded; her laugh 
was too loud, her eyes sparkled too 
brightly; there was something feverish 
about the way she embraced the city. 
She possessed it. And then one day 
she changed again... and a great 
sigh settled on her, and the cloud 
came into her eyes...
Now Gavin Elster has signed the check, and he and his wife 
rise and start for the door. Scottie still cannot get an 
unobstructed view of her face, but we can see in flashes 
that she is young, in her twenties, with a mobile, attractive 
face and gentle eyes that have warmth and intelligence and 
humor. Scottie is intent on her. At the doorway to the bar, 
only two feet from him, she stops and waits as her husband 
pauses behind her to speak to the headwaiter and thank him 
and tip him. She looks about calmly, with sure, distant 
repose. Her eyes come to rest an Scottie for a moment, then 
move an with the small smile. During all of the above, 
Elster's voice has gone on, without pauses, and his narration 
ends as the girl, Madeleine, comes to a stop near Scottie 
and waits.
ELSTER'S VOICE
I don't know what happened that day: 
where she went, what she saw, what 
she did. But on that day, the search 
was ended. She had found what she 
was looking for, she had come home. 
And something in the city possessed 
her.
As Scottie stares at her, their eyes meet for a moment, and 
he turns to reach for his drink. When he turns back, she is 
gone. He looks about, slightly startled, then catches a 
glimpse of her as she turns the corner of the upstairs lobby. 
His eyes grow thoughtful, and glow with the memory of her 
face.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BROCKLEBANK APARTMENTS - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
Scottie, seated in his car, a light grey sedan, is reading 
the morning paper. The car radio is going and we hear 
conventional disc jockey music. He glances out through his 
windshield.
BROCKLEBANK APTS. - (DAY) - LONG SHOT FROM HIS POV
We see a large block of apartments with a stone pillared 
entrance and a small car parked inside. Beyond it is the 
door into the apartment building itself. There is no activity 
but for one businessman who emerges on foot and makes his 
way out.

A slightly nearer view but still outside the stone entrance 
of the apartment house, we see the main entrance beyond. For 
some time, there is no activity at all - perhaps for a quarter 
of a minute or so. Suddenly, we see Gavin's wife, MADELEINE, 
appear. She is dressed in a smart light grey tailored suit. 
She stands for a moment looking about her.

Scottie's surprised expression, as he peers through the 
partially open door. Suddenly, he catches sight of:
INT. FLOWER SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
Madeleine is talking to one of the assistants, making some 
inquiry. The assistant, who seems to know her, nods with a 
smile and goes off to the side of the store. Madeleine waits 
and begins to turn, looking around the store. She approaches 
camera until she is again in profile - just as she was in 
Ernie's Restaurant when Scottie first saw her.
INT. FLOWER SHOP - CLOSEUP - SCOTTIE
Cautiously narrows the opening of the door.
INT. FLOWER SH0P - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
The female assistant returns. She is carrying a small nosegay 
of flowers. Madeleine nods her approval and, as the assistant 
returns, we see Madeleine indicate she will take it as it 
is. Madeleine begins to open her purse as the assistant starts 
to write out the bill.
INT. FLOWER SHOP - (DAY) - CLOSEUP SCOTTIE
Cautiously, closes the door.
INT. PASSAGE - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
We see Scottie retreating from the door and hastening down 
the passage towards the CAMERA. He goes out left and as he 
opens the door into the alleyway, the daylight streams in 
for a moment.
EXT. ALLEYWAY - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
Scottie emerges from the doorway, passing the green Jaguar. 
We are far enough away to see the sign over the doorway, 
which tells us that it is the rear entrance to the flower 
shop, for customers' parking.
EXT. ALLEYWAY - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
Scottie comes from the Jaguar across the alleyway to where 
his own car is standing. He gets in. After a moment or two, 
we see Madeleine emerge in the distance and get into the 
Jaguar, carrying the nosegay. There is a sound of the starter, 
and immediately, she is on her way. In the f.g., the grey 
sedan moves off at a cautious distance behind.

He comes to a stop in CLOSEUP.
INT. MISSION DOLORES - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

for the strong light around the altar. The church is 
completely empty.
INT. MISSION DOLORES - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
Scottie half-turns as though to retrace his steps, then he 
looks back again and leans to one side slightly.
INT. MISSION DOLORES - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
Shooting on a slightly different angle, we see there is a 
small door at the far end at the right-hand side of the altar. 
It is slowly closing.

We see Scottie emerge from the church coming towards the 
CAMERA, which DOLLIES BACK with him.

Scottie looking towards Madeleine with an expression of slight 
surprise. He starts off out of the picture to the right.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
We see Scottie making his way down the side of the graveyard,

Scottie cautiously steps back a little.
EXT. GRAVEYARD (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
The CAMERA watching the corner of the grotto for a moment. 
Nothing happens, then we hear a few steps and Madeleine comes 
into view still carrying the posy of flowers. She is walking

she is in full profile. She opens her purse and takes out a 
small handkerchief, then she moves on around the path towards 
the exit.

Market Street and start to ascend the hill.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY)
We see both cars, one behind the other, moving uphill.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ENTRANCE TO LINCOLN PARK - (DAY)
The two cars move along the road through the entrance, between 
the trees, and the Jaguar draws up before the Palace of the 
Legion of Honor. Scottie continues past as Madeleine gets 
out of her car and walks through the courtyard to the entrance 
to the art gallery. Scottie parks his car farther along, and 
follows her in.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ART GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - LONG SHOT
Shooting through the foreground columns we see the gallery, 
soft lit from the top, completely empty, save for one person. 
It is Madeleine. She is seated on the small wooden bench at 
the far end. Her head is tilted in the upward direction, 
gazing at a large portrait. Slowly we see Scottie coming to 
the left f.g. He watches her for a moment and then with a 
carefully quiet stop, moves into the gallery and starts to 
examine the pictures.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
The CAMERA SHOOTING on the back of Scottie, TRAVELS, with 
him as he pretends to look at the pictures on the wall. He 
barely stops at each one. Now and again he half furtively 
glances over his shoulder. Finally the CAMERA COMES TO A 
STOP. Scottie cautiously turns around and looks across the 
room.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
From his viewpoint we get a complete picture of what he sees. 
The back view of Madeleine, seated on the polished wooden 
bench, her right band is holding the nosegay, and beyond her 
a three-quarter length portrait of a beautiful blonde woman, 
dressed in 19th century costume. She seems to be looking 
down with an enigmatic smile.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - CLOSEUP
Scottie's eye catches sight of:
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - CLOSEUP
The nosegay resting in Madeleine's hand on the polished wood 
seat. The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP and MOVES IN to a part of 
the picture. It comes to rest on a nosegay held in the woman's 
hands.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - CLOSEUP
Scottie's expression does not change. His eyes move to 
something else.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - CLOSEUP
SHOOTING on the back of Madeleine, we see her head and 
shoulders only. The CAMERA MOVES IN until her bun of blonde 
hair fills the screen. The CAMERA PANS up until we see the 
head and shoulders of the woman in the portrait. She is 
wearing a distinctive diamond pendant necklace. Then the 
CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN and concentrate its attention at a 
bun of hair resting on the nape of her neck.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - CLOSEUP
Scottie's eyes turn thoughtfully at the memory of his 
conversation with Gavin. He looks up again.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
Again, the enigmatic look of the woman wearing the diamond 
pendant necklace. It seems as though she is almost looking 
at Scottie.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
Scottie turns and makes his way carefully back down the 
gallery.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
THE CAMERA is now back in its original position, beyond the 
columns of the entrance to the room. We see Scottie coming 
down toward the CAMERA. As he comes to us in CLOSER SHOT, we 
see him beckon to somebody off screen.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - MEDIUM SHOT
A male attendant is coming over towards the CAMERA. He goes 
out of the picture.
INT. GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - MEDIUM SHOT
He comes to where Scottie awaits him. Scottie asks in a low 
voice:
SCOTTIE
(Nodding in the 
direction of the 
gallery)
Who is the woman in the portrait?
The Attendant turns his head.
SCOTTIE
The one where the lady is sitting.
ATTENDANT
Oh, that's Carlotta, sir.
(At Scottie's reaction)
You'll find it in the catalogue: 
"Portrait of Carlotta."
Scottie nods his thanks as the attendant hands him a 
catalogue. Scottie then turns back and looks into the room. 
The CAMERA MOVES IN past him, so that once more we are left 
alone with Madeleine seated, still looking at the portrait.
LAP DISSOLVE:
EXT. ART GALLERY - (AFTERNOON) - MEDIUM SHOT
In the f.g., Scottie is seated in his grey sedan. We see 
beyond him in the distance, the green Jaguar and the back-
lit columns of the gallery courtyard. Presently, the small 
figure of Madeleine appears. She gets into her car and starts 
to drive off. Scottie starts up his engine. His car moves 
across the screen.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. A SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY)
The two cars moving along through a poorer section of San 
Francisco. We see that the houses - many large - are all of 
wood, shabby, run-down, some almost derelict. The occasional 
front yard is uncared for; the few people on the street are 
cheaply dressed. There is a meanness of atmosphere.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
The green Jaguar comes to a stop outside a large house, which 
has seen grander days. Obviously an old San Francisco 
residence, it is now become an apartment hotel. A long flight 
of steps from the street, leads to the front door, which has 
a semicircular canopy supported by columns.
Madeleine gets out and ascends the stairs toward the hotel 
entrance; she is still carrying the posy of flowers.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
Scottie's car pulls into the curb. He gets out and stands on 
the sidewalk and looks ahead of him. He walks forward out of 
the picture.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
We see Scottie walking along the sidewalk casually. The green 
car is at the curb at the left of the stairs to the hotel. 
He strolls up until he reaches the green car.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
SHOOTING over the green car, we see Scottie hovering around 
the bottom of the steps. There is no sign of Madeleine. She 
has obviously gone in by this time. Scottie turns and examines 
the facade of the hotel and over his shoulder, the CAMERA 
PANS up over the building where we see the name, in worn 
black lettering under the top cornice.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Scottie turns away from the hotel and glances in the direction 
of the car. He then turns and ponders what his next move 
should be. No looks back at the hotel. Suddenly, his eye 
catches sight of something. He hastens over to conceal himself 
by the entrance wall, the CAMERA PANNING him. His eyes go 
up again.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
From his viewpoint, we see Madeleine appear in the corner 
second story window. She is glancing out casually, as she 
takes off the jacket of her suit. She turns into the room 
again.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Scottie is really puzzled by this appearance. He thinks for 
a while and then, making up his mind, starts to go up the 
steps, the CAMERA PANNING him. We see him reach the top stop 
and make for the front door.
EXT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
Scottie waits a slight moment, and then, bracing him himself, 
opens the door and passes through.
INT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP
Scottie comes through the door closes it behind him. He looks 
around.
INT. MCKITTRICK HOTEL LOBBY - (DAY)
From Scottie's viewpoint, we see most of the lobby. There is 
a small reception desk with a key rack to one side, but the 
strongest and most immediate impact is one of greenery, of 
foliage. Scattered about the lobby in profusion are tall- 
standing potted rubber plants and philodendron. Scottie 
stands and stares. There is no one to be seen, no sign of 
life. Then we see a leaf of a rubber plant move, and move 
again, a hand appears, seemingly caressing it, and then we 
hear a woman's voice.
MANAGERESS
Yes?
Scottie looks in that direction, and the woman moves out 
from behind the plant. She is a small, gentle, elderly lady 
with white hair, motherly and smiling, with bright, eager 
eyes.
MANAGERESS
Is there something I can do for you?
SCOTTIE
Yes... you run this hotel.
MANAGERESS
Oh, yes!
SCOTTIE
Would you tell me, who has the room 
on the second floor in the corner, 
that corner?
MANAGERESS
(Brightly)
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out 
information of that sort. Our clients 
are entitled to their privacy, you 
know. And I do believe it's against 
the law! Of course, I don't think 
any of them would mind, really, but 
still I would have to know who you 
are, and ask --
By now Scottie has got out his wallet and has shown his badge, 
and the sight of it makes her stop abruptly, and for a moment 
her face hardens and is not a bit motherly. But then she 
recovers her innocent brightness.
MANAGERESS
Oh, dear! Has she done something 
wrong?
SCOTTIE
Please answer my question.
MANAGERESS
I can't imagine that sweet girl with 
that dear face --
SCOTTIE
(Urgently)
What is her name?
MANAGERESS
Valdes. Miss Valdes.
(Pause. Then, brightly)
It's Spanish, you know.
SCOTTIE
(Slowly)
Carlotta Valdes?
MANAGERESS
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't 
it? Foreign. But sweet.
SCOTTIE
(Holding in)
How long has she had the room?
MANAGERESS
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the 
rent's due tomorrow.
SCOTTIE
Does she sleep here? Ever?
MANAGERESS
No... she only comes to sit. Two or 
three times a week. And I never ask 
questions, you know. As long as 
they're well behaved. I must say 
that I've wondered --
SCOTTIE
(Cutting her off)
When she comes down, don't say that 
I've been here.
And he turns away to go, wondering.
MANAGERESS
(Brightly)
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. 
Scottie whirls back on her.
SCOTTIE
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
MANAGERESS
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! 
I would have seen her, you know. 
I've been right here all the time, 
putting olive oil on my rubber plant 
leaves!
Scottie stares at her smiling, innocent face. She looks over 
at the key rack.
MANAGERESS
And there! There you see? Her key is 
on the rack!
SCOTTIE
(Heavily)
Would you please go and look?
MANAGERESS
In her room? Well, yes, of course if 
you ask. But it does seem silly...
She puts down the can of olive oil and the sponge, and gets 
out her passkey. She goes up the stairs. Scottie watches her 
go, then stares down at the can of olive oil, stares at the 
rubber plant, and waits, and looks up the stairs.
MANAGERESS (O.S.)
(Brightly)
Oh, Mr. Detective! Would you like to 
come and look?
Scottie starts up the stairs on the run.
INT. LANDING OF SECOND FLOOR - (DAY)
The Manageress stands near the open door. Scottie brushes 
past her and stands on the threshold.
INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - (DAY)
We are looking at the room over the shoulders of Scottie and 
the woman. It is empty. Scottie crosses to the window and 
looks down. From his viewpoint we see the empty space at the 
street curb where stood Madeleine's Jaguar.
SCOTTIE
Her car is gone.
MANAGERESS
What car?
He turns to look at her sweet, smiling face, then turns back 
to stare down out of the window in bewilderment.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BROCKLEBANK APARTMENTS - (DAY)
Scottie's sedan pulls up in the foreground, the building in 
the distance. He looks across. There, half concealed around 
the corner of the small car park, is the green Jaguar. 
Scottie strolls over, inspects the cars, then looks inside. 
On the seat is the small nosegay bought at Podesta's and 
carried to the cemetery.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. MIDGE'S APARTMENT - (DAY)
Midge is at work on a nightgown ad. The phonograph is playing 
softly: probably Bach, probably harpsichord, probably 
Landowska. Scottie walks in, and Midge looks up, startled.
SCOTTIE
Midge, who do you know that's an 
authority an San Francisco history?
He walks over and turns the phonograph off, either here or a 
bit later.
MIDGE
Now, that's the kind of greeting a 
girl likes. None of this "hello you 
look wonderful" stuff. Just a good 
straight "who do you know" --
SCOTTIE
(breaking in)
Well, who? Come on, you know 
everybody.
MIDGE
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
SCOTTIE
Not that kind of history. The small 
stuff! About people you never heard 
of!
MIDGE
Oh! You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days 
of Gay Old San Francisco! The juicy 
stories? Like who shot who in the 
Embarcadero August, 1879?
SCOTTIE
Yeah.
MIDGE
Pop Leibel.
SCOTTIE
Who?
MIDGE
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. 
What do you want to know?
SCOTTIE
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in 
August, 1879.
Starts for the door fast.
MIDGE
Wait a minute! You're not a detective 
any more. What's going on?
SCOTTIE
(Pausing)
Do you know him well?
MIDGE
Pop Leibel? Sure.
SCOTTIE
All right, come on. Introduce me. 
Where is your hat?
He looks about for it.
MIDGE
(Speeding to the door)
I don't need a hat. Johnny, what's 
it about?
She speeds right on through the open door.
SCOTTIE
I'll tell you later. Wait a minute!
He races out after her.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ARGOSY BOOK SHOP - (DUSK)
It is old, it is misty, it is filled with old books, but the 
important thing to note is that it is filled with memorabilia 
of California pioneer days: on the walls are not only the 
familiar old maps and prints but also, and more striking, 
such things as framed old mining claims, posters describing 
outlaws wanted by the law, Wells Fargo Pony Express Posters; 
and on the shelves, old whiskey bottles, gold-mining pans, 
and such. The proprietor, Pop Leibel, is staring with a 
nodding smile at the piece of paper Scottie has handed him, 
and Scottie watches him keenly. In the bag, Midge wanders 
about the shop, inspecting the prints on the wall, but always 
listening.
POP LEIBEL
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the 
Sad Carlotta...
SCOTTIE
What does a big old wooden house on 
the corner of Eddy and Gough Street 
have to do with her?
POP LEIBEL
It was hers. It was built for her. 
Many years ago.
SCOTTIE
By whom?
POP LEIBEL
By... no... the name I do not 
remember. A rich man, a powerful 
man. It is not an unusual story. 
She came from somewhere small, to 
the south of the city... some say 
from a mission settlement... young, 
yes; very young. And she was found 
singing and dancing in a cabaret by 
the man... wait... wait... Ives! 
His name was Ives! Yes. And he took 
her and built for her this great 
house in the Western Addition... and 
there was a child. Yes. This was it. 
The child.
Scottie hangs on his words. Pop looks up at him and smiles.
POP LEIBEL
And now, fragments, you understand. 
I cannot tell you how much time 
passed, or how much happiness there 
was. But then he threw her away. He 
had no other children; his wife had 
no children. He kept the child and 
threw her away. Men could do that in 
those days. They had the power... 
and the freedom. And she became the 
Sad Carlotta. Alone in the great 
house... walking the streets alone, 
her clothes becoming old and patched 
and dirty... the Mad Carlotta... 
stopping people in the streets to 
ask, "Where is my child?... have you 
seen my child?".
The store has darkened considerably and all the figures are 
practically silhouettes. The CAMERA picks up a CLOSE SHOT OF 
MIDGE, listening intently, her head turned away from the 
wall toward the old man. And on the wall near her head is a 
print of mission San Juan Bantista as it was in the old days.
MIDGE
The poor thing....
SCOTTIE
And she died...
POP LEIBEL
She died.
SCOTTIE
How?
POP LEIBEL
By her own hand.
(Pause. Smiles as 
sadly)
There are many such stories.
SCOTTIE
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you 
very much.
Forgetting Midge, he turns and walks out of the store fast, 
deep in thought.
MIDGE
Hey, wait a minute! So long, Pop! 
Thanks a lot! She dashes out after 
Scottie.
EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE ARGOSY BOOK SHOP - (DUSK)
Midge catches up with Scottie and stops him by grabbing his 
arm.
MIDGE
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
SCOTTIE
For what?
MIDGE
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
SCOTTIE
Nothing to tell.
MIDGE
You'll tell, or you'll be back in 
that corset! Come on!
SCOTTIE
I'll take you home.
He starts off with long strides, and Midge hurries after 
him.

Scottie's car draws up and comes to a stop.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (EARLY EVENING) - MEDIUM TWO SHOT
Scottie and Midge are looking straight ahead.
SCOTTIE
Here you are.
MIDGE
You haven't told me everything.
SCOTTIE
I've told you enough.
MIDGE
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
SCOTTIE
Out. I've got things to do.
MIDGE
I know. The one who phoned. Your old 
college chum, Elster.
SCOTTIE
Out!
MIDGE
And the idea is that the Beautiful 
Mad Carlotta has come back from the 
dead, to take possession of Elster's 
wife? Ah, Johnny! Come on!
SCOTTIE
(Angrily)
I'm not telling you what I think! 
I'm telling you what he thinks!
MIDGE
Think? Well, what do you think?
Scottie is troubled, lost in thought.
Pause.
MIDGE
Is she pretty?
SCOTTIE
Carlotta?
MIDGE
(Evenly)
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
SCOTTIE
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Midge looks up at him from the corners of her eyes.
MIDGE
(Wickedly)
I think I'll go take a look at that 
portrait.
(With a bright smile)
Bye!
She opens the car door quickly and jumps out.
SCOTTIE
(Outraged)
Midge!
MIDGE
Bye-bye!
She slams the car door and runs into the house. Scottie glares 
after her for a moment, then his face relaxes, and he is 
lost in thought. He reaches into the glove compartment of 
the car and draws out the catalogue of the permanent 
collection of the Palace of the Legion of Honor. He opens it 
to a page and stares down.
INSERT - THE REPRODUCTION OF THE PORTRAIT OF CARLOTTA.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GAVIN ELSTER'S CLUB - (NIGHT)
Elster and Scottie are seated in the lounge of a San Francisco 
Club - there are one or two members reading newspapers, etc., 
while a waiter moves by in the background serving drinks. 
Elster is studying the reproduction of the portrait of 
Carlotta in the catalogue that Scottie procured from the 
gallery.
The waiter leans in and places two drinks before them. 
Scottie watches Elster, waiting for him, to speak. Finally:
ELSTER
(With a wan smile)
You've done well, Scottie. You're 
good at your job.
SCOTTIE
That's Carlotta Valdes.
ELSTER
Yes.
SCOTTIE
There are things you didn't tell me.
ELSTER
I didn't know where she was going to 
lead you.
SCOTTIE
But you knew about this.
ELSTER
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she 
does her hair.
He places a finger on the reproduction of the portrait to 
indicate the bun at the back of the neck. Scottie nods.
ELSTER
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, 
has several pieces of jewelry that 
belonged to Carlotta. She inherited 
them. Never wore them, they were too 
old-fashioned... until now. Now, 
when she is alone, she gets them out 
and looks at them handles them gently, 
curiously... puts them on and stares 
at herself in the mirror... and goes 
into that other world... is someone 
else again.
SCOTTIE
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's 
grandmother?
ELSTER
Great-grandmother. The child who was 
taken from her whose loss drove 
Carlotta mad and to her death - was 
Madeleine's grandmother.
SCOTTIE
(Confidently)
Well, that explains it. Anyone could 
develop an obsession for the past, 
with a background like that.
ELSTER
But she doesn't know, about her 
background.
(As Scottie stares, 
narrowly)
She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
SCOTTIE
Knows nothing of a grave out at 
Mission Dolores, or an old house an 
Eddy Street, or a portrait at the 
Palace of the Legion of Honor?
ELSTER
Nothing.
SCOTTIE
And when she goes to those places...
ELSTER
She is not my wife.
The two men stare at each other directly, honestly.
SCOTTIE
How do you know all these things she 
doesn't know?
ELSTER
Her mother told me most of then before 
she died. I dug out the rest for 
myself, here.
SCOTTIE
Why did she never tell her daughter? 
ELSTER
Natural fear. Her grandmother went 
insane and took her own life. And 
the blood is in Madeleine.
(Pause)
Scottie, I ask you to watch her 
closely.
Scottie raises his glass and drinks slowly, thoughtfully.

EXT. PALACE OF THE LEGION OF HONOR - (LATE AFTERNOON)
The columns of the courtyard are back lit by the sun. There 
is no sign of life. Near the steps, standing alone and empty, 
is the green Jaguar.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE ART GALLERY - (LATE AFTERNOON)
SHOOTING through the columns in the foreground, our view of 
the room is obscured momentarily by an elderly couple moving 
toward the door. They go by to reveal Scottie standing by a 
Rodin sculpture, looking into the room, and far beyond him, 
at the end of the room, Madeleine seated on the bench before 
the portrait staring at it. In her hand, resting at her side 
on the bench, is once again the nosegay. Now she rises and 
approaches the portrait and stands before it, the nosegay 
clasped in her two hands before her, and stares up almost as 
though in votive offering or in prayer. Finally she turns 
and starts toward the entrance. Scottie slips away out of 
sight. Madeleine walks slowly toward the CAMERA.

level clearing. The green Jaguar stands there, empty.
EXT. BRIDGE - (SUNSET) - MEDIUM SHOT
Scottie gets out of his car and looks off out of picture.
EXT. BRIDGE - (SUNSET) - LONG SHOT
Madeleine walking away round the dockside. The vast bridge 
towers above her. She carries the nosegay. Scottie moves 
into the f.g., and makes off in the same direction. Madeleine 
disappears round the corner of the old fort wall. Now she 
is out of sight, we see Scottie quicken his pace as he 
approaches the corner of the fort wall.
EXT. BRIDGE - (SUNSET) - MEDIUM SHOT
SHOOTING back, we see Scottie approach the wall and peer 
cautiously around.
EXT. BRIDGE - (SUNSET) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
From his viewpoint, we see Madeleine standing at the waters'

from the nosegay.

A moment in which her body seem poised, and then she is gone, 
lost to view in the water.

Scottie dashes around the wall and the CAMERA PANS him to 
the water's edge. He is throwing his coat off.

SCOTTIE, running down the few stone steps towards the water. 
When the water is up to his knees, he swims out towards her.

Her eyes staring, sinks beneath the water. She is surrounded 
by the scattered flowers. Scottie swims in and grabs her.

As he holds her, the two heads are pressed together. He turns 
and starts to swim back with her. The screen is filled with 
their two heads. Madeleine's staring eyes begin to close as 
she is moved away.

We see Scottie coming up some stone steps. He is staggering 
with the weight of Madeleine's water-soaked body and clothes. 
He carries her over towards the green Jaguar.

Resting her for a moment, he throws open the door on the

EXT. DOCKSIDE - (SUNSET)
Scottie's head is close to hers. She is now breathing heavily.
SCOTTIE
(whispering)
Are you all right?
Her eyes open slowly.
SCOTTIE
(Calling softly)
Madeleine...
Her eyes show no sign of recognition or response; they move 
past his face and stare out. The CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN 
until her head fills the screen. She stares out as though in 
a trance.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT.SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (DUSK)
The empty green Jaguar is drawn up at the curb before the 
red door of a small, well-kept house.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
We are in the living room of a comfortable a bachelor 
apartment. There is a picture window that looks up to Coit 
Tower on Telegraph Hill. The room is softly lit. A fire is 
lit in the fireplace; the logs are blazing well, Scottie, in 
a pair of grey trousers and an old sweater, is wandering 
about the room, trying to think things out. Through an open 
door we can see into a small kitchen where Madeleine's clothes - 
all of them - hang, on a cord over the electric stove, drying. 
And through another open door we can see into the bedroom 
where Madeleine lies, in the larger-than-single bed, under 
the covers, asleep. She sighs and turns restlessly, and 
Scottie glances at her from the living-room as he wanders, 
and then she turns again, and the sigh becomes words, spoken 
in sleep, and he stops, and listens.
MADELEINE
(Faintly, distantly)
Please... thank you... please...
Scottie waits, taut, but there is no more. He starts to turn 
away and suddenly, still distant, but more clearly:
MADELEINE
(Appealingly)
Where is my child?... have you seen 
my child...?
Scottie stiffens with the shock of recognition and his eyes 
go wide with apprehension staring at the lost, eye-closed, 
troubled woman in the bed. And at that moment the telephone 
on the bedside table rings sharply. He makes a dash for it. 
The ringing brings the woman to with a sharp start, and she 
instinctively clutches the bedclothes to her chin and raises 
up a little and stares with wide-eyed fright at the man 
running towards her. Scottie takes the phone.
SCOTTIE
Yes?... No, it's all right; I'll 
call you back. Yes. Yes!
He hangs up, and tries to smile down at Madeleine, who has 
not moved, but has followed his every move with fright and 
apprehension.
SCOTTIE
Are you all right?
No answer, only the eyes staring at him. And then he realizes, 
with some embarrassment, that she cannot move, that she is 
naked under the bedclothes, and he reaches across to the 
dressing gown he has laid out for her on the bed, and moves 
it closer to her.
SCOTTIE
Oh... you'll want this...
He gives her a reassuring nod and smile, straightens up and 
goes to the door, and goes into the living room, closing the 
bedroom door behind him. And she stares after him as he goes. 
In the living room, he moves to the fireplace, puts another 
log on, and watches it catch. The bedroom door behind him 
opens, and he turns to face Madeleine. She has the dressing 
gown belted tightly around the middle and holds it together 
with one band at her breast. And she stands there staring at 
him nervously, frightened, not wanting to admit that she 
does not know how she came there, but wanting very much to 
know. And she cannot help herself: knowing her own fears, 
she has to ask.
MADELEINE
Why am I here? What happened?
SCOTTIE
You...
(Then, not liking the 
sound of the truth)
...fell into the Bay.
She puts a hand slowly to her hair, understanding now why it 
is wet.
SCOTTIE
I dried your hair as well as I could. 
But you'd better come here by the 
fire.
And now, knowing that he dried her hair, she realizes that 
he must have taken her clothes off, too, and she looks down 
at her body with deep awareness of her nakedness, and draws 
the dressing gown more closely to her, and looks back at him 
with frightened embarrassment. And her head begins to move 
quickly, the eyes darting about the apartment as though 
seeking a way of escape, and she sees the clothes hanging in 
the kitchen. And she looks back to Scottie appealingly. 
SCOTTIE
They're almost at dry. Here. Why 
don't you come over here?
He pulls a low-stool over before the fire. Madeleine crosses 
slowly, keeping her eyes always on him, and sinks down on 
the stool. He smiles a at her companionably.
SCOTTIE
Would you like some coffee?
She shakes her head.
SCOTTIE
You'd better have some. Or would you 
rather have a drink?
She shakes her head again. He pours a cup of coffee and places 
it on the floor next to her, along with a bowl of sugar cubes.
MADELEINE
(Wonderingly)
...fell into the bay...
She looks up at him. He nods.
MADELEINE
...and you fished me out...
He nods. She gives him a small grateful smile.
MADELEINE
Thank you.
Scottie is watching her intently.
SCOTTIE
You don't remember.
MADELEINE
No...
SCOTTIE
Do you remember where you were?
MADELEINE
(Childishly surprised)
Oh, of course I remember that! But 
then I must have had a dizzy spell, 
and fainted!
SCOTTIE
(Quickly)
Where were you?
MADELEINE
At...
For that one slight, imperceptible moments it may seem that 
she is caught, but then she goes on.
MADELEINE
(Triumphantly)
...Old Port Point! Out at the 
Presidio! Of course I remember! I 
often go there!
SCOTTIE
Why?
MADELEINE
(Almost naively)
Because I love it so. It's beautiful 
there. Especially at sunset.
(She leans her head 
back sensually to 
the warmth)
Ah... thank you for the fire.
SCOTTIE
Where had you been before?
MADELEINE
When?
SCOTTIE
This afternoon.
MADELEINE
Oh... wandering about.
SCOTTIE
Before? Where? Where had you been?
There is a quick moment of blankness in her eyes that she 
tries to hide, and then:
MADELEINE
(Positively)
Downtown, shopping.
And Scottie sighs inwardly, having proved something.
SCOTTIE
Please drink your coffee.
MADELEINE
I will. You're terribly direct in 
your questions.
SCOTTIE
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
MADELEINE
You're not. Merely direct. What were 
you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
SCOTTIE
Wandering about.
MADELEINE
You like it, too.
He nods. She smiles at him happily, enjoying the warmth and 
the coffee, enjoying his presence, seemingly almost to have 
forgotten her nearness to death. And Scottie is fascinated 
by this thing curled up before his fire.
MADELEINE
(Then with a wicked 
smile)
And where had you been?... just 
before?
A moment, as Scottie takes a deep breath, and then he decides 
to chance it and see the reaction.
SCOTTIE
The Palace of the Legion of honor. 
The Art Gallery.
MADELEINE
(Enthusiastically)
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? 
I've never been inside. But it looks 
so lovely, driving past.
At the words, "I've never been inside," Scottie is startled. 
He stares at her, and she looks at him with naive, happy 
inquisitiveness, and their looks are joined. Finally she 
drops her eyes and smiles timidly.
MADELEINE
(Softly)
Lucky for me you were wandering about.
Thank you again. I've been terrible 
bother to you.
SCOTTIE
No.
She reaches up to feel her hair.
MADELEINE
When you...
(And suddenly conscious 
of her nakedness 
again, and embarrassed)
There were pins in my hair...
SCOTTIE
Oh! Yes! Here!
He crosses the room swiftly, picks up an ash tray in which 
he had deposited her hairpins, takes her handbag from a chair, 
and brings them to her.
MADELEINE
Thank you.
She proceeds to do up her hair. He watches her, held by the 
movement of her body under the dressing gown as she raises 
her arms and deftly sets about putting her hair in order. At 
one point, as she works, she looks up and flashes him a direct 
smile.
MADELEINE
You shouldn't have brought me here, 
you know.
SCOTTIE
I... didn't know where you lived.
MADELEINE
You could have looked in my car. Oh, 
but you didn't know my car, did you?
SCOTTIE
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's 
out there, now. But I didn't think 
you'd want to be brought home that 
way.
MADELEINE
No, you are right,
(Pause, as she works)
I'm glad you didn't take me home... 
I wouldn't have known you, to thank 
you...
(Suddenly appalled)
Oh, but I don't know you! And you 
don't know me! My name is Madeleine 
Elster.
SCOTTIE
My name is John Ferguson.
MADELEINE
That's a good, strong name. Do your 
friends call you John? Or Jack.
SCOTTIE
John. Old friends. Acquaintances 
call me Scottie.
MADELEINE
(Smiling)
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
SCOTTIE
(Grinning)
No, I wouldn't like that. And after 
what happened today I should think 
you could call me Scottie. Or even 
John.
MADELEINE
I prefer John. There, that's done.
(The hair is in order)
And what do you do, John?
SCOTTIE
Wander about.
MADELEINE
That's a good occupation. And live 
here... alone?
He nods. A cloud comes over her eyes. She looks away.
MADELEINE
(softly)
One shouldn't live alone.
SCOTTIE
Some people prefer it.
MADELEINE
No... it's wrong.
Then she looks up with a small smile, and the cloud is gone 
from her eyes, and she speaks completely matter-of-factly.
MADELEINE
(Simply)
I'm married, you know.
Scottie nods almost imperceptibly with his eyes. He looks at 
her for a long moment. Then:
SCOTTIE
Will you tell me something? Has this 
ever happened to you before?
MADELEINE
(startled)
What?
SCOTTIE
...Falling... into San Francisco 
Bay?
She laughs with relief, for it seemed to her, for a quick 
moment, that he was going to say "falling in love".
MADELEINE
No, never before. I've fallen into 
lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a 
little girl. And I fell into a river, 
once, trying to leap from one stone 
to another. But I've never fallen 
into San Francisco Bay. Have you? 
Ever before?
SCOTTIE
(Grinning)
No... this is the first time for me, 
too.
And they laugh together, with genuine warmth and friendliness 
in their eyes, and it is obvious they are very much taken 
with each other. And as they laugh, simultaneously, she 
reaches for the cup of coffee, to take another sip, and he 
reaches for it, meaning to take it and refill it.
SCOTTIE
Here, let me give you a lit --
And his hand falls on her outstretched arm and stays there, 
and with the contact made, the laughter dies suddenly, and 
he is looking down at her intently, and their eyes have met, 
and hers are anxious and wondering. And at that moment, the 
telephone rings sharply. Scottie races into the bedroom, 
closing the door behind him, and gets to the phone.
SCOTTIE
Hello.
ELSTER'S VOICE
Scottie, what happened? She's not 
home, yet.
SCOTTIE
No, she's all right. She's still 
here. But I'll get her home soon.
ELSTER'S VOICE
What happened?
SCOTTIE
She... went into the Bay.
There is a long silence.
SCOTTIE
Hello?
ELSTER'S VOICE
Did she hurt herself?
SCOTTIE
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to 
worry about. But she doesn't know. 
You understand that. She doesn't 
know what she did.
Another long silence.
ELSTER'S VOICE
Scottie... Madeleine is twenty-six. 
Carlotta Valdes committed suicide 
when she was twenty-six.
And now it is Scottie's turn to be silent. He hangs up slowly 
and moves across the room to the door.
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - (NIGHT)
Scottie enters from the bedroom, and stops, surprised. The 
room is empty. The clothes are gone from the in the kitchen.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
A car is moving down the hill on the opposite side of the 
street. It begins to turn in toward the sidewalk and then 
comes to a sudden stop.
EXT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT) - CLOSEUP
Midge is behind the wheel. She is staring out of the side of 
the window and we see what has made her come to a sudden 
stop.
EXT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
From Midge's point of view; Madeleine, outside Scottie's 
door, hurries to the green Jaguar.
INT. MIDGE'S CAR - (NIGHT)
Midge watches Madeleine almost wistfully, and there is a 
small look of hurt in her eyes. But even to herself she has 
to cover, and she smiles ironically.
EXT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
The Jaguar pulls away and passes out of view.
INT. MIDGE'S CAR - (NIGHT)
Midge is still staring across at Scottie's house, and the 
soft smile on her lips covers the hurt well. But there is 
still a shadow of it in her eyes.
MIDGE
(Softly)
Well, now, Johnny-O... Was it a 
ghost?... And was it fun?...
Then she suddenly changes expression.
MIDGE
Oops!
She takes her foot off the brake, and turning hard on the 
wheel, straightens the car up and drives on.
EXT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
The door to Scottie's apartment has opened, and Scottie stands 
in the doorway looking up and down the street for the Jaguar, 
his tall frame silhouetted in the light streaming from the 
room.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BROCKLEBANK APTS. - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
The CAMERA is SHOOTING through the stone gateway across the 
small courtyard toward the front door of the apartments. We 
see Madeleine emerge. She is dressed completely different 
from the night before. She makes her way down to the Jaguar 
in the f.g. She gets in, starts up and swings the car round 
toward the CAMERA. She passes out of the picture.
EXT. BROCKLEBANK APTS. - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
Across the street, we see Scottie's sedan pull out and also 
approach the CAMERA. It too, passes out of the picture.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Scottie sitting at the wheel driving ahead. His eyes are 
satisfied. They hold Madeleine's car in view.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
We see the Jaguar ahead. It turns a left down another street. 
It goes for a block and turns right. Then it turns left again, 
than it turns right, then it turns left again.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Scottie looks a little dizzy with the constant turning. We 
stay with him a little while and we can see from the scene 
behind him, that we are still turning left and right.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
The Jaguar speeds up. It's going down a street, not turning 
any more. A few blocks off, we can see the Coit Tower coming 
into view.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Scottie seem a little mystified now, as the direction in 
which she is going.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
The Jaguar turns right into a narrow curving street and 
finally comes to a sudden stop ahead.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Scottie now wears a look of great astonishment, as he pulls 
up hurriedly in the middle of the street.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
From his viewpoints, we see the reason for his astonishment. 
Madeleine has alighted and is approaching, of all places, 
toward his own red front door.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
Scottie pulls his car over to the curb and gets out. The 
CAMERA PANS him down. He stops short just before he reaches 
Madeleine, to see her take a letter from her handbag and put 
it into his letter box. He moves up to her.
SCOTTIE
Is that for me?
Madeleine turns quickly, startled, and then sees who it is, 
and smiles.
MADELEINE
Oh! Yes. Hello.
SCOTTIE
Good morning. I worried about you, 
last night. You shouldn't have run 
like that.
MADELEINE
(Embarrassed)
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
SCOTTIE
I wanted to drive you home. Are you 
all right?
MADELEINE
(Flashing a smile)
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.
(Then, ruefully)
But as I remember now, that water 
was cold, wasn't it?
(He nods. She looks 
away)
What a terrible thing to do... and 
you were so kind...
(With a gesture)
It's a formal thank-you letter. And 
a great big apology.
SCOTTIE
You've nothing to apologize for.
MADELEINE
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have 
been so embarrassing for you!
SCOTTIE
Not at all, I enjoyed --
And he stops short, now truly embarrassed, and she looks at 
him with wide eyes, waiting for him to go on.
SCOTTIE
-- talking to you...
MADELEINE
(With small, contained 
amusement)
I enjoyed talking to you.
An awkward pause. Scottie turns abruptly to the door, getting 
out his key.
SCOTTIE
I'll get my mail...
He opens the door and bends down to pick up the letter. As 
he is reaching for it, he turns his head and speaks almost 
without thinking.
SCOTTIE
Would you like some coffee?
MADELEINE
(Quickly)
No! No, thank you!
She says it so impulsively, and with such young vehemence, 
that they both start to laugh. He straightens up and opens 
the letter.
MADELEINE
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know 
your address. But I had a landmark. 
I remembered Coit Tower and it led 
me straight to you.
SCOTTIE
The first time I've been grateful 
for Coit Tower.
He reads the letter as she watches him. He looks up.
SCOTTIE
I hope we will, too.
MADELEINE
What?
SCOTTIE
Meet again, sometime.
MADELEINE
We have.
They smile at one another, and there is a nice moment of 
silent rapport. Then:
MADELEINE
Good-bye.
SCOTTIE
Good-bye.
She turns and goes to her car as he stands watching her, and 
gets in behind the wheel.
SCOTTIE
(Suddenly walking)
Where are you going?
And he races to the car and leans in the window. She watches 
him, open-mouthed, as he crosses the sidewalk. Then:
MADELEINE
I don't know.
SCOTTIE
Shopping?
MADELEINE
No.
SCOTTIE
Well... anywhere in particular?
MADELEINE
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
SCOTTIE
Ah.
(Then)
That's what I was going to do.
MADELEINE
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your 
occupation, isn't it?
And she waits with a small smile.
SCOTTIE
Don't you think it's sort of a waste 
for the two of us to...
MADELEINE
Wander separately? Ah, but only one 
is a wanderer. Two, together, are 
always going somewhere.
SCOTTIE
No... no, I don't think that's 
necessarily true.
And now he waits, hopefully.
MADELEINE
(With a smiling nod)
You left your door open.
He turns his head, startled and annoyed, than makes a dash 
for the door. As he goes, he turns his head to call back to 
her.
SCOTTIE
Don't move!
And he hurries on to the door. She watches him go, and we 
are close on her face to see her genuine amusement, and then 
the laughter fades a little, and a troubled look comes into 
her eyes, a touch of concern.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ALONG SKYLINE - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
The green Jaguar moving south.
INT. THE JAGUAR - (DAY)
Madeleine is at the wheel, her eyes intent on the road, a 
sort, happy smile on her lips. Scottie is at her side, 
relaxed. He keeps looking at her as often as he can without 
seeming obvious.
SCOTTIE
(Finally)
Do you know where you're going?
MADELEINE
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!
(Pause. Then brightly)
I'd like to go somewhere I've never 
been!
SCOTTIE
How can you be sure?
MADELEINE
If I've been there? That's silly! 
Either you've been to a place or you 
haven't.
She flashes a quick smile of innocence at him, then returns 
her eyes to the road. He looks at her profile, wondering.
EXT. SKYLINE DRIVE - (DAY) - HIGH SHOT
The car turns a bend and approaches dark woods and moves 
into the blackness and is swallowed up.
DISSOLVE TO:
BIG BASIN REDWOODS STATE PARK - (DAY)
The empty Jaguar in the foreground. The CAMERA MOVES to a 
long view of the grove of redwoods. In the distance we see 
the figures of Madeleine and Scottie wandering among the 
towering trees.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE REDWOODS - (DAY)
Madeleine and Scottie near the massive trunk of a tree. 
Beyond them, the small stream, bridged by a wide flattened 
redwood log.
MADELEINE
How old?
SCOTTIE
Oh... some, two thousand years, or 
more.
MADELEINE
The oldest living things?
Scottie nods and watches her, wondering, as she looks about 
thoughtfully.
SCOTTIE
You've never been here before.
She shakes her head, lost in thought as she lets her gaze 
wander among the trees.
SCOTTIE
What are you thinking?
MADELEINE
(Searching)
Of all the people who have been 
born... and have died... while the 
trees went on living.
SCOTTIE
(Agreeing)
Their true name is Sequoia 
Sempervirens: always green, ever-
living.
MADELEINE
(Flatly)
I don't like them.
SCOTTIE
Why?
MADELEINE
(Simply)
Knowing I have to die...
She looks up at him with a shy, embarrassed smile. Then, 
seeing the wandering look in his eyes, she brightens quickly.
MADELEINE
But I like the stream! It's a lovely 
stream!
She leaves him and moves quickly out onto the bridge and 
loans on the railing to watch the water rippling below. And 
then, as he approaches her, she turns and looks at him, wide-
eyed.
MADELEINE
But it makes no sound! Listen!
She listens intensely for a long moment, and looks at him 
anxiously.
MADELEINE
Do you hear anything?
SCOTTIE
(Shaking his head)
Only silence. It's always like this.
MADELEINE
(Wondering)
And no birds sing.
SCOTTIE
No birds live here.
MADELEINE
No.
She turns away with gentle, somber, self-contained wonder, 
and they cross back to the path in silence, and wander on 
along the path in silence. We watch them move away in the 
distance, disappear behind a tree, then come into view again, 
and now there comes into view the cross-section of a redwood 
tree that is on exhibit, with certain of its rings marked to 
show what it has lived through, and they approach it.
SCOTTIE
Would you like a drink of water? 
MADELEINE
No, thank you.
Scottie moves to the small upright drinking fountain as 
Madeleine approaches the tree section and stands before it 
and studies it. Scottie gets a drink of water, then comes up 
behind Madeleine and stands, and she is seemingly unaware of 
his presence. Their backs are to the CAMERA. INSERT OF RINGS 
on the tree, marked with dates, beginning, near the center 
with the date 909 A.D. and ending with 1930 - tree cut down.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT
We see the two profiles: Madeleine staring at the tree, 
Scottie staring at Madeleine. She raises one gloved hand and 
almost idly begins to trace a finger up along the white line 
that is marked: 1776 DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. And as the 
hand moves a little to the left, Madeleine begins to speak, 
almost vacantly, oblivious of all but this piece of tree, 
and herself.
MADELEINE
Somewhere in here I was born... and 
here I died and it was only a moment 
for you... you took no notice...
SCOTTIE
(Almost sharply)
Madeleine!
She turns her head to him, only now aware of his presence, 
and stares at him without expression. Then slowly she turns 
and walks away, and the CAMERA, PANNING HER SLIGHTLY, brings 
the head and shoulders of Scottie into the foreground, and 
he watches her, wondering anxiously, trying to put things 
together in his mind. Madeleine walks on until she disappears 
behind one of the distant redwoods.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
Scottie moves over, watching her.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
The CAMERA MOVES OVER as though it is Scottie looking. It 
MOVES far enough to reveal that Madeleine is no longer there. 
She seems to have disappeared.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
Scottie comes forward, the CAMERA PANNING him, to get a better 
view of where Madeleine went.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
The CAMERA in Scottie's position, moving around, shows that 
there is no sign of Madeleine whatsoever.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
The CAMERA DOLLIES Scottie down toward the trees.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
CAMERA is now among the trees where Madeleine was last seen. 
As it TRAVELS across them, it finally brings her into view. 
She's leaning against a tree with her head bent back.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Scottie comes to a stop as he sees her.
EXT. RED WOODS - (DAY) - CLOSEUP
Madeleine leaning against the tree. Her eyes are closed and 
she is breathing heavily. In the background we see Scottie 
approaching her. As he comes up to her, the CAMERA EASES 
BACK and MOVES AROUND until it faces her and Scottie.
SCOTTIE
(Gently)
Madeleine...
She opens her eyes slowly, and looks at him, recognizing 
him, and yet not quite, as though she were slightly 
hypnotized. Scottie speaks gently.
SCOTTIE
Where are you now?
MADELEINE
(Softly, distantly)
Here with you.
SCOTTIE
Where?
MADELEINE
The tall trees...
SCOTTIE
Have you been here before?
MADELEINE
Yes...
SCOTTIE
When?
She shakes her head.
SCOTTIE
Where were you born?
MADELEINE
Long ago...
SCOTTIE
Where?
She shakes her head.
SCOTTIE
When?
Her head continues to move back and forth, gently denying. 
His voice is more positive, now, more urgently demanding.
SCOTTIE
Tell me.
The head moves more rapidly, now, as though denying some 
inner compulsion.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine! Tell me!
The rapidly moving head stops short, and her eyes open wide, 
and she cries out:
MADELEINE
No!... No!
SCOTTIE
(Low and urgent)
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? 
What takes you away?
MADELEINE
No, don't ask me!
They are both speaking quickly, now, the words cascading 
without pause.
SCOTTIE
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't 
know where you were. You guessed but 
you didn't know.
MADELEINE
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I 
fell!
SCOTTIE
Why did you jump?
MADELEINE
No!
SCOTTIE
What was it inside that told you to 
jump?
She is fighting it strongly, yet pathetically.
MADELEINE
No, I can't tell you!
SCOTTIE
What?!
MADELEINE
(Strongly)
No! Please! Please, please, please, 
please, don't ask me!
And her head drops, and she sags, and Scottie stands quietly 
watching her, knowing he can push it no further.
MADELEINE
(Softly, tired)
Take me away from here?
SCOTTIE
Home?
MADELEINE
...somewhere in the light.
He takes her arm. She looks up at him with a tired smile.
MADELEINE
And promise you won't ask me again. 
Please promise me that.
He looks down at her somberly, promising and refusing nothing. 
They start walking, holding together, and the two figures 
become small in the distance, moving away through the tall 
trees.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CYPRESS POINT OR POINT LOBOS - (DAY) SAME DAY.
Below the point of land, the sea pounds against the rocks. 
Madeleine stands alone, silhouetted against the sky. Scottie 
sits in the car, watching her. She does not move. Then slowly 
she starts to walk toward the sea, and as he watches he 
senses, without being sure, that her pace is increasing, and 
suddenly he opens the car door and jumps out and slams the 
door and begins to run. But then he sees something, and slows 
down quickly and walks, for Madeleine has stopped and turned 
and is waiting for him. There is a gentle, apologetic smile 
in her eyes. She waits, and he comes to a stop before her.
MADELEINE
Why did you run?
He looks down at her searchingly.
SCOTTIE
(Finally, quietly)
I'm responsible for you now, you 
know. The Chinese say that once you 
have saved someone's life, you are 
responsible for it forever. And so 
I'm committed. And I have to know.
MADELEINE
And you'll go on saving me? Again 
and again?
He waits. She looks down.
MADELEINE
There is so little I know. It is as 
though I were walking down a long 
corridor that once was mirrored, and 
fragments of mirror still hang there, 
dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark 
image of me... and yet not me... 
someone else, in other clothes, of 
another time, doing things I have 
never done... but still me... And I 
can't stop to ask why, I must keep 
on walking. At the and of the corridor 
there is nothing but darkness, and I 
know when I walk into the darkness, 
I'll die.
(Pause; she looks up)
But I've never come to the and; I've 
always come back, before then. Except 
once.
SCOTTIE
Yesterday.
She nods.
SCOTTIE
And you didn't know. You didn't know 
what happened. Until you found 
yourself there with me.
She shakes her head.
SCOTTIE
You don't know where you were.
She shakes her head.
SCOTTIE
But the small scenes, the fragments 
in the mirror: you remember them.
MADELEINE
Vaguely...
SCOTTIE
What do you remember?
MADELEINE
(Searching)
A room... there is a room, and I sit 
there alone... always alone... 
SCOTTIE
Would you know the room?
MADELEINE
No... it's in shadow.
SCOTTIE
What else?
MADELEINE
A grave...
SCOTTIE
Where?
MADELEINE
I don't know. An open grave. I stand 
by the gravestone looking down into 
it. And it's my grave.
SCOTTIE
How do you know?
MADELEINE
I know.
SCOTTIE
There's a name on the gravestone.
MADELEINE
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
SCOTTIE
(Beginning to feel 
lost)
What else?
MADELEINE
(Searching)
This part is dream, I think. There 
is a tower and a bell and... a garden 
below... but it seems to be in 
Spain... a village in Spain. And 
then it clicks off, and is gone.
SCOTTIE
A portrait? Do you ever see a 
portrait?
MADELEINE
No.
SCOTTIE
Of the woman in the mirror. Would 
you know her if you saw her?
MADELEINE
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
SCOTTIE
(Desperately)
No!
She looks up at him, rebuffed, desperately lost, and her 
eyes well with tears. Scottie is looking away, lost in 
thought.
SCOTTIE
(To himself)
If I could find the key... find the 
beginning put it together...
MADELEINE
(Quietly, lost)
And so explain it away? But there 
is a way to explain it, you see. If 
I'm mad? That would explain it, 
wouldn't it?
Scottie looks at her, and her eyes are big with fright and 
despair and a plea for denial, and suddenly she breaks, and 
the tears flow, and she turns her head away sharply and turns 
and runs toward the edge of the land.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine!!
He races after her and catches her and holds her, and she is 
against him, clinging tightly, deep in his embrace, and 
sobbing fiercely.
MADELEINE
(Muffled, against his 
breast)
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't 
want to die, but there's someone 
inside me, there's a somebody else, 
and she says I must die... Scottie, 
don't let me go!
SCOTTIE
I'm here, I've got you...
MADELEINE
I'm so afraid...
(She looks up)
...you won't let it happen...
Her face is close to his and they are clinging tightly 
together. He shakes his head, and then suddenly his mouth is 
on hers, and they are deep in a kiss. Their lips part, but 
remain close together.
MADELEINE
(Whispering)
Don't leave me... stay with me...
SCOTTIE
All the time.
They kiss again, passionately. And the wind blows and the 
waves dash against the rocks, throwing up a curtain of spray.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. MIDGE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
Outside the terrace darkness is falling, and the lights of 
the city have come on. In Midge's apartment the lights are 
on and soft music comes from the radio (possibly "progressive 
jazz" of the gentle George Shearing kind). Midge is painting 
at a standing easel; She has a palette; obviously she is 
painting in oils. We cannot see what she is painting; the 
canvas on stretchers has its back to us. Its size is about 
thirty by forty inches. Whatever it is, it seems to please 
her: she pauses in her work, picks up a highball from a table 
nearby, drinks and stares at the painting and giggles a little 
to herself than applies a few more daubs. Now she hears the 
outside gate slam. She puts down the brush and the drink, 
moves the easel a bit so that the canvas cannot be seen from 
the front door, picks up a water tumbler that contains a 
small nosegay, and hurries out to the kitchen with it. The 
door to the apartment slams.
SCOTTIE
(Calling)
Midge?
Midge hurries out of the kitchen.
MIDGE
Hi, Johnny! Did you get my message?
She immediately goes to the small sideboard or table on which 
are bottles, glasses, and ice, and mixes him a highball. 
Scottie is at ease. He drops his hat on a chair near the 
door and wanders into the room.
SCOTTIE
I did. Since when do you go about 
slipping notes under men's doors?
MIDGE
Since I stopped being able to get 
them on the phone. For a man who has 
nothing to do, you're certainly a 
busy little bee. Where do you go, 
these days?
SCOTTIE
Just wander.
MIDGE
Where?
SCOTTIE
Around.
MIDGE
Oh?
She hands him the drink. He takes a long pull at it as she 
watches him.
SCOTTIE
Mm. Better.
MIDGE
Did you need it?
SCOTTIE
Yeah.
MIDGE
Oh?
She crosses the room to get her own drink, giving a flick of 
a glance at the canvas as she goes. Scottie watches her, 
slightly amused, knowing that her curiosity is working like 
mad.
SCOTTIE
What was this desperate urge to see 
me?
MIDGE
All I said in the note was: "Where 
are you?" That doesn't sound desperate 
to me.
SCOTTIE
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
MIDGE
I just thought if I gave you a drink 
and fed you some dinner, you'd be so 
grateful you'd take me to a movie.
SCOTTIE
Fair enough. What'll we talk about 
at dinner?
MIDGE
Oh... this and that.
SCOTTIE
What I've been doing?
MIDGE
If you want to. Naturally, we won't 
talk about anything you don't want 
to talk about.
SCOTTIE
Naturally.
Pause.
MIDGE
(Innocently)
What have you been doing?
SCOTTIE
(With small grin)
Wandering.
He takes another long pull and wanders over and sweetens the 
drink. Midge moves a little to block his view of the easel 
and canvas.
SCOTTIE
What have you been doing?
He wanders back into the room.
MIDGE
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! 
I've gone back to my first love... 
painting.
SCOTTIE
Good. I've always said you were 
wasting your time in the underwear 
department.
MIDGE
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited 
about this.
SCOTTIE
What is it, a still life?
MIDGE
No, not exactly. Want to see?
Scottie moves toward the easel and Midge backs away, so that 
as he comes around to face the canvas she in beyond him, in 
back of him. As he moves toward the easel:
MIDGE
As a matter of fact, I thought I 
might give it to you.
SCOTTIE
(smiling, surprised)
Oh?
And now he comes around to face the easel and stops to look. 
Beyond him Midge's face has a great smile of anticipation. 
And now we see what he sees. The CAMERA RESTS on the lower 
half of the canvas and we see the folds of the blue and gold 
gown, and the two hands, one holding the nosegay. The CAMERA 
PANS UP to reveal that it is a hasty but quite creditable 
copy of the "Portrait of Carlotta", half size, but there is 
one difference. The face is Midge's face.
INT. MIDGE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
Scottie staring at the portrait. Beyond him, Midge smiling 
with anticipation. Scottie's face is drained and 
expressionless, and a deep look of sadness and regret comes 
into his eyes.
Pause.
SCOTTIE
(Softly)
Not funny, Midge.
Midge's smile fades. She is puzzled and surprised. Scottie 
puts down his drink gently and without looking at her, starts 
for the door.
MIDGE
Johnny!
Scottie takes his hat from the chair and moves on to the 
door. Midge, completely taken aback, starts for him.
MIDGE
But Johnny, I thought you would --
She breaks off as he turns his head to look at her. He's not 
at all angry, but disturbed inside and sorry it happened.
SCOTTIE
(Nicely)
We'll make that movie some other 
night, huh?
And he goes out the door and closes it behind him.
MIDGE
(Desperately apologetic)
But Johnny...!!!
And she stares at the door with a "Well-I'll-be-damned" 
expression. And now, abruptly, she gets angry at herself.
MIDGE
Ah, no!!
She turns away and moves toward the canvas
MIDGE
Oh! Marjorie Wood!! You fool!!
She stops before the canvas and stares at her face in the 
portrait. And all her anger at herself comes out in one great 
blast of scorn.
MIDGE
(At the portrait)
OH!!!!!
And she picks up a brush and with three vicious daubs paints 
a moustache and a beard on her image. Then she throws the 
brush out the window.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. UNION SQUARE - (NIGHT)
It is about 3 a.m. The Square is deserted -- perhaps an odd 
taxi or car drives by. We see Scottie, a solitary figure, 
walking. By his attitude, head down, hands thrust into his 
pockets, we see that he is lost in thought wrestling with 
his problem.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (EARLY DAWN)
Scottie is in the easy chair facing the fire asleep. His tie 
is loosened, his shirt is open at the neck. It is clear that 
he fell asleep while sitting there thinking of Madeleine, 
and slept through the night. The fire is almost out. Through 
the window we can barely distinguish Coit Tower in the 
beginning of a grey dawn. The doorbell begins to ring 
instantly. There is a knocking on the door. Scottie awakens 
sharply, gathers himself together, hurries to the door and 
opens it. Madeleine stands there, looking shaken and white 
and frightened. She is wearing a black suede jacket and black 
slacks. Behind her, fingers of mist swirl in the lightening 
day. She stands there staring at him pleadingly.
SCOTTIE
What's the matter?... What time is 
it?... Madeleine, what's happened?
He draws her in and closes the door and leads her into the 
room.
MADELEINE
(Barely)
I should have phoned... but I wanted 
to see you... be with you...
SCOTTIE
Why? What's happened?
MADELEINE
I had the dream. The dream came back 
again...
She is trembling, and he holds her closely.
SCOTTIE
It's all right. You're all right, 
I'll get you some brandy.
He breaks away to a small cupboard nearby.
MADELEINE
(Sharply)
No, don't go away!
SCOTTIE
Only this far.
He gets out a bottle of brandy and a small glass and uncorks 
the bottle and pours the brandy as he comes back to her.
SCOTTIE
Here. Straight down, it's medicine.
She takes a sip and puts the glass away.
SCOTTIE
Where's your husband?
MADELEINE
I didn't wake him. I don't want him 
to know...
She is still shaking.
SCOTTIE
Here, now, it's going to be all right. 
Here.
He gently pushes her down in the easy chair, turns swiftly 
and kicks up the fire and throws some wood on. He pulls the 
low stool up before her, sits on it, and takes her hands.
SCOTTIE
It was a dream, you're awake, you're 
all right, now. Can you tell me?
MADELEINE
It was the tower again... and the 
bell, and the old Spanish village...
SCOTTIE
Yes --
MADELEINE
But clear... so very clear... for 
the first time... all of it...
SCOTTIE
Tell me.
MADELEINE
There was a village square, a green 
with trees... and an old whitewashed 
Spanish church with a cloister. 
Across the green: a big, grey, wooden 
house with a porch and shutters and 
a balcony above... a small garden, 
and next to it, a livery stable... 
with old carriages lined up inside.
Scottie has been listening intently with growing awareness, 
and now as she mentions the livery stable, his eyes glow 
with the excitement of recognition.
SCOTTIE
Go on.
MADELEINE
At the end of the green there was a 
whitewashed stone house with a lovely 
pepper tree at the corner --
SCOTTIE
(Finishing it)
-- and an old wooden hotel of the 
old California days, and a saloon... 
dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging 
oil lamps.
MADELEINE
Yes?! But --
SCOTTIE
(Gently)
It's all there. It's no dream.
Pause, as she stares at him, puzzled, anxious.
SCOTTIE
You've been there before. You've 
seen it.
MADELEINE
No, never!
SCOTTIE
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of 
San Francisco there's an old Spanish 
Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. 
It's been preserved exactly as it 
was a hundred years ago as a museum. 
Now, think hard, darling. You've 
been there before. You've seen it!
MADELEINE
(Frightened)
No, never! I've never been there! 
Scottie, what is it? I've never been 
there!
Long pause as they stare at each other, he desperately trying 
to think it through, shes moved and frightened. He rises and 
moves away, anxious and shaken.
SCOTTIE
(To himself)
Carlotta...
He shakes his head angrily, fighting the idea. Madeleine 
watches him anxiously.
SCOTTIE
What was it he said? She came from 
somewhere south of the city... some 
say a mission settlement...
He turns on Madeleine almost desperately.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine, think hard!!
She shakes her head frantically, hopelessly, close to tears.
Pause.
SCOTTIE
(Quietly)
Go on with your dream. What was it 
that frightened you?
MADELEINE
I stood alone on the green, searching 
for something, and I started to walk 
to the church. But then the darkness 
closed in, I was alone in the dark, 
being pulled into darkness, and I 
fought to wake up...
She looks at him, frightened again by the memory. He goes to 
her reassuringly.
SCOTTIE
You're going to be all right now, 
Madeleine. I've got something to 
work on now. I'm going to take you 
there -- to the Mission -- this 
afternoon. And when you see it, you'll 
remember when you saw it before, and 
that will finish your dream and 
destroy it. I promise. You'll be 
free.
She looks up at him and tries to smile.
SCOTTIE
All right?
She nods.
SCOTTIE
I'll take you home. If your husband 
is awake, say you couldn't sleep and 
went out for some air. And come back 
to me about noon. Come along.
He raises her to her feet. She smiles up at him gratefully.
MADELEINE
No, I'll go alone. I'm all right.
They stand there for a moment, looking at each other.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY SOUTH OF SAY FRANCISCO - (DAY)
Tall trees line the road on both sides and arch across to 
meet high above, forming a long shadowy tunnel shot through 
with streamers of sunlight. We are as though in the front 
seat, of a car, traveling fast, looking up and ahead to the 
distant end of the tunnel, and the trees flash by.
EXT. THE HIGHWAY - (DAY)
Another angle to show the green Jaguar traveling along the 
road through the tunnel of trees.
INT. THE JAGUAR - (DAY)
Madeleine and Scottie; he is at the wheel, staring straight 
ahead, lost in thought. Madeleine, now smartly-dressed in 
her grey suit, is staring up at the tunnel of trees. Scottie 
glances at her. She smiles at him timidly.
EXT. THE HIGHWAY - (DAY)
SHOOTING down the road toward the end of the tunnel of trees, 
and the Jaguar moving away fast. It sets clear of the trees 
and into daylight.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE HIGHWAY: A ROAD JUNCTION - (DAY)
Side angle SHOT of the Jaguar as it turns off onto a side 
road. The CAMERA PANS the car, then loses it as it goes out 
of the SHOT, and HOLDS on a road sign that reads:
MISSION SAN JUAN BAUTISTA 3 MILES
EXT. MISSION SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (DAY)
We are looking along the cloisters, down the long corridor 
of arches. In the foreground a small sign a standard reads:
EL CAMINO REAL
MISSION SAN JUAN BAUTISTA FOUNDED 
JUNE 24, 1797
The music of the Mission theme, mingled with Carlotta's theme, 
begins to drift in, an evocation of the past; a sighing that 
grows end seem to have behind it the echo of lost voices 
calling. The CAMERA MOVES AND EASES AROUND A BIT to look 
through the arches across the green toward the open side and 
the valley and the hills beyond. A lone nun is crossing the 
green to the church. A clock strikes the half hour. The CAMERA 
PANS to look at the large wooden two-story house on the far 
side of the green, then the little garden, then the Plaza 
Livery Stable, and the road alongside. The Jaguar stands 
there empty. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN along the whitewashed 
stone Castro House, sees the pepper tree, MOVES along the 
Plaza Hotel, and comes to REST SHOOTING at the saloon that 
forms the far corner of the hotel. Three tourists exit from 
the entrance of the hotel, get into their car. The car moves 
toward the CAMERA, and goes past, and out of the SHOT. The 
CAMERA DOLLIES IN to the front door of the saloon. Over the 
door is a sign: PLAZA HOTEL BAR ROOM.
On either side of the door are posters proclaiming rewards 
for the apprehension of bandits who have held up Wells Fargo 
Express Wagons. The CAMERA SHOOTS THROUGH the open door.
INT. PLAZA HOTEL BAR ROOM - (DAY)
Empty, silent; old pool tables in the foreground, the bar in 
the background. As the CAMERA SCANS the room:
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. PLAZA HOTEL FRONT PARLOR - (DAY)
It too is silent and deserted. In the far wall, a fireplace, 
with an old clock on the mantel. In one corner, small old 
organ, with a hymnal open on the rack; in the other corner, 
a Victorian sofa. The flowered rug is faded, the furniture 
is shabby.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - (DAY)
Looking toward the lovely pepper tree and the whitewashed 
stone Castro Rouse, and the tall eucalyptus tree beyond. The 
CAMERA PANS SLOWLY past the empty Jaguar and come to REST on 
the dark opening of the Livery Stable and MOVES SLOWLY toward 
it.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LIVERY STABLE - (DAY)
The dark interior of the Livery Stable. The figures of Scottie 
and Madeleine are seen a little way in. Madeleine is seated 
in a surrey, while Scottie stands by her.
INT. LIVERY STABLE - (DAY)
Madeleine's eyes are closed. Scottie, leaning against the 
surrey, looks up at her intently. After moment he calls to 
her softly.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine...?
She opens her eyes and looks down at him.
SCOTTIE
Where are you now?
She smiles at him gently.
MADELEINE
(Softly)
Here with you.
SCOTTIE
And it's a all real.
MADELEINE
Yes.
SCOTTIE
(Firmly)
Not merely as it was a hundred years 
ago. As it was a year ago, or six 
months ago, whenever you were here 
to see it.
(Pressing)
Madeleine, think of when you were 
here!
She looks down at him with, a worried, regretful smile, 
wishing she could help him. Then she looks away into the 
distance, and speaks almost at irrelevantly.
MADELEINE
(Dreamily)
There were not so many carriages, 
then. And there were horses in the 
stalls; a bay, two black, and a grey. 
It was her favorite place, but we 
were forbidden to play here, and 
Sister Teresa would scold us...
Scottie looks up at her in desperation, then looks about the 
stable for help. His look scans the carriages and wagons 
lined against the wall, goes past the old fire truck on which 
there is a placard proclaiming the world's championship of 
1884, and finally stops at a small buggy -- a Bike Wagon -- 
To which is hitched a full-sized model of a handsome grey 
horse.
SCOTTIE
Well, now, here!
He races to the horse. On it hangs a sign: "Greyhound World's 
Greatest Trotter."
SCOTTIE
Here's your grey horse! Course he'd 
have a tough time getting in and out 
of a stall without being pushed, but 
still... You see? There's an answer 
for everything!
He looks across to Madeleine eagerly. She is staring ahead, 
lost in the past.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine! Try!
No answer. The music is more insistent, now, a pulling wind,, 
and the faint voices call more clearly. Madeleine slowly 
rises to her feet as though sensing the call. Scottie moves 
back to her and stands there looking up. He raises his arms, 
she puts her bands on his shoulders and slips to the ground 
with his help, and he is holding her. Their heads are close 
together.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine, try... for me...
With a small movement, their lips come together, and they 
kiss; not impulsively, as before, but with deep, sure love 
and hunger for each other. Their lips part, but he still 
holds her tightly, his head pressed down against hers, and 
she is looking past him, her eyes wide with anxiety. And a 
clock strikes the three-quarter hour.
SCOTTIE
My love... because I love you.
MADELEINE
(Whispering)
I love you too... too late... too 
late...
SCOTTIE
No... we're together...
MADELEINE
Too late... there's something I must 
do...
He holds her gently, now; brushes his lips along her to her 
eyes, down to her mouth.
SCOTTIE
(murmuring)
Nothing you must do... no one 
possesses you... you're safe with 
me... my love...
And they kiss again. As they part:
MADELEINE
Too late...
She looks up at him with deep regret and wonder in her eyes 
then suddenly breaks from him and runs out the door. He stands 
still, startled for a moment, then runs after her.
EXT. LIVERY STABLE - (DAY)
Madeleine is running across the grass toward the church. 
Scottie catches up with her.
EXT. LIVERY STABLE - (DAY) - REVERSE ANGLE
Scottie swings her around to face him.
SCOTTIE
(Firmly)
There are things I have to tell you, 
about how we met, and why we are 
together. But they can wait. The 
only important thing now is that I 
love you and I'm going to keep you 
safe.
MADELEINE
(Trembling)
You can't.
SCOTTIE
Why?
MADELEINE
Let me go.
SCOTTIE
Where?
MADELEINE
To the church, I must go there.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine --
MADELEINE
Please let me go.
She pulls away and turns and walks swiftly toward the church, 
her head bowed. CAMERA DOLLIES with her. She is frightened, 
and close to tears. Scottie follows her a half-step behind. 
The livery stable drops away out of the SHOT, and the two 
heads fill the screen with only the sky an background.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine, don't fight me off, don't 
put me away. You've been fighting 
alone, and you're lost, but no more. 
Hold on to me. Be sure of me, always. 
And whatever it is, we'll lick it. I 
promise.
No answer. They keep walking, and then suddenly with head 
bowed, she begins to run again, and runs out of the SHOT. A 
moment, then he runs after her.
EXT. THE MISSION AND CLOISTERS - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT
We see Madeleine running toward the Cloisters, Scottie after 
her. Finally he stops her once again.
EXT. THE CLOISTERS - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT
Scottie grabs her by the arm.
MADELEINE
(Head low, brokenly)
It's not fair, it's too late. It 
wasn't supposed to happen this way, 
it shouldn't have happened...!
SCOTTIE
It had to. We're in love. That's all 
that counts. Madeleine --
MADELEINE
(Frantic, struggling)
Let me go! Let me go!!
SCOTTIE
(Holding her; sharply)
Madeleine!!
The struggle ceases. She remains limp in his grasp for a 
long moment, then slowly raises her head to look at him. Her 
eyes study his face searchingly.
MADELEINE
You believe that I love you?
SCOTTIE
Yes.
MADELEINE
And if you lose me, you'll know that 
I loved you and wanted to go on loving 
you.
SCOTTIE
I won't lose you.
Pause.
MADELEINE
Let me go into the church alone.
SCOTTIE
Why?
MADELEINE
Please. Because I love you. He stares 
at her, sees the pleading look in 
her eyes, and lets go. She turns and 
walks away toward the church, slowly, 
her head bowed. He watches her go 
and starts to move after her. Then 
slowly, as she goes, her head begins 
to go up until finally, as she walks, 
she is staring high above her. And 
then, suddenly, she breaks into a 
broken run.
EXT. CLOISTERS - (DAY)
Scottie jerks his head up to see what she was looking at.
EXT. CLOISTERS - (DAY)
From Scottie's viewpoint: the high church tower.
EXT. CLOISTERS - (DAY)
Scottie, immediately alarmed, brings his eyes down and looks 
toward the church entrance.
EXT. CLOISTERS - (DAY)
From Scottie's viewpoint: Madeleine runs through the open 
front door of the church, and vanishes.
EXT. CLOISTERS - (DAY)
Scottie starts to run toward the church.
SCOTTIE
Madeleine!!!
He runs to the church door and runs in.
INT. CHURCH, SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (DAY)
Scottie runs in and looks around frantically. The church is 
empty. A moment, then he hears the sound of footsteps running 
up wooden steps. He turns in the direction of the sound, 
sees a door standing open at the side of the church, and 
through the door the beginning of a flight of steps. He runs 
to the open door and goes through.
INT. CHURCH TOWER - (DAY)
Scottie runs in, stops at the foot of the steps, hears the 
running footsteps, and looks up. From his viewpoint we see 
Madeleine running up the open stairway that spirals up along 
the walls of the high tower. She is already well on her way. 
Scottie is immediately stricken by vertigo, and the tall 
tower seems to slide away from him. He makes an attempt to 
start up the stairs, flattens himself against the wall and 
struggles up. He claws his way up, crosses over to the hand- 
handrailing and uses it to pull his body up the steps, one 
by one railing struggling for breath, unable to call, though 
he tries. And Madeleine keeps running. Madeleine reaches 
the top goes through a small wooden door. We see it slam, 
hear it locked. Scottie, struggling up, reaches a landing 
next to a small open arch that looks out on the back garden, 
and has to stop to tight his nausea. There is a scream from 
above. Through the arch he sees a body fall. He calls 
"Madeleine"!, and looks down through the arch.
EXT. ROOF - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
Figure of the dead Madeleine. Her body is lying on the roof 
of the cloister.
INT. CHURCH TOWER - (DAY)
The vertigo hits Scottie again and the body and the root of 
the cloister move and fall away into space, and this
DISSOLVES THROUGH TO:
The body of the policeman falling from the rooftop, tumbling 
through space to the street below. Scottie has to look away 
in desperate horror. He hears voices, looks through the arch 
again, and sees two nuns hurrying across the garden from the 
dormitory at the back, looking up at the roof of the cloister. 
He turns and gazes down the great height he now has to 
descend, flattens himself against the wall, and with 
trancelike desperation tries to start moving.

Once again we see the whole of the square, but now, in sharp

that encircles the green.
EXT. MISSION SAW JUAN BAUTISTA - (DAY) - LONG SHOT
Before Plaza Hall, the large grey wooden building next to 
the Livery Stable, and on its front porch, groups of citizens 
are gathered, talking. Some people glance up to the second 
floor, where the windows are open, and from which a droning 
voice can faintly be heard. The CAMERA ZOOMS UP to the open 
window, and as it does, the voice of the speaker becomes 
louder and the words more intelligible.
INT. PLAZA HALL ROOM, SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (DAY)
The Coroner's Inquest is in session. The Jury of twelve local 
people is at one side. Among the people assembled we see: 
the two nuns, escorted by a priest; Gavin Elster with
his attorney; some State Patrolmen; and, of course, Scottie. 
Next to him is a burly man in his fifties in civilian clothes; 
almost obviously a detective and obviously Scottie's one 
friend there. He is Detective Captain Fred Hansen of the San 
Francisco Police.
At the front of the room is the Official who is speaking, a 
rather testy old man. Behind him, on the wall are an old, 
crudely hand-made American Flag from the last century, and a 
California Bear Flag.
(NOTE: THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE FOLLOWING SPEECH COVERS 
THE RISE AND ENTRANCE OF THE CAMERA AND BECOMES INTELLIGIBLE 
ONLY AT ITS END.)
OFFICIAL
Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was 
not well with his wife's mental state, 
took the preliminary precaution of 
having her watched by Mr. Ferguson 
lest any harm befall her, and you 
have heard that Mr. Elster was 
prepared to take his wife to an 
institution where her mental health 
would have been in the hand of 
qualified specialists. And Mr. 
Ferguson, being an ex-detective, 
would have seemed the proper choice 
for the role of watchdog and 
protector. As you have learned, it 
was an unfortunate choice.
(pause)
However, I think you will agree that 
no blame can be attached to the 
husband. His delay in putting his 
wife under medical care was due only 
to the need information as to her 
behavior that he expected to get 
from Mr. Ferguson. He had taken every 
precaution to protect his wife. He 
could not have anticipated that Mr. 
Ferguson's "weakness" his "fear of 
heights", called "acrophobia", would 
make him powerless when he was most 
needed.
(pause)
As to Mr. Ferguson: you have heard 
his former superior, Detective Captain 
Hansen, from that great city to the 
north, testify as to his character 
and ability. Captain Hansen was most 
enthusiastic. The fact that Mr. 
Ferguson once before, under similar 
circumstances, allowed a police 
colleague to tall to his death, 
Captain Hansen dismissed as an 
"unfortunate Incident."
Captain Hansen's eyes narrow and his face reddens. Scottie 
stares at the floor dully, oblivious to what is being said.
OFFICIAL
Of course Mr. Ferguson is to be 
congratulated for having once saved 
the woman's life when, in a previous 
fit of aberration, she threw herself 
into the Bay. It is a pity that 
knowing her suicidal tendencies he 
did not make a greater effort the 
second time. But we are not here to 
pass judgment on Mr. Ferguson's lack 
of initiative. He did nothing, and 
the law has little to say on the 
subject of things left undone.
(pause)
Nor does his strange behavior after 
he saw the body fall have any bearing 
on your verdict. He did not remain 
at the scone of the death. He ran 
away. He claims he suffered a mental 
blackout and knew nothing more until 
he found himself back in his own 
apartment in San Francisco several 
hours later. You may accept that or 
not. Or, you may believe that, having 
once again allowed someone to die, 
he could not face the tragic result 
of his own weakness, and ran away. 
That has nothing to do with your 
verdict. It is a matter between him 
and his conscience.
(pause)
Now. From the evidence of the mind 
of Madeleine Elster prior to her 
death, from the manner of her death, 
and from the Postmortem examination 
of the body showing the actual cause 
of her death, you should have no 
difficulty in reaching your verdict. 
Gentlemen, you may retire.
The Foreman of the jury leans across to his colleagues, and 
they go into a huddle. After a short whispered consultation 
there is a general nodding of heads, then the Foreman stands.
FOREMAN
We've reached the verdict.
OFFICIAL
And what is your verdict.
FOREMAN
We find that Madeleine Elster 
committed suicide while being out of -- 
while being out of unsound mind.
OFFICIAL
Your verdict will be so recorded. 
Dismissed.
People start to rise. There is a general exodus toward the 
doorway and the stairs leading down to the ground floor. 
Scottie remains impassive, still staring at the floor. People 
stare at him curiously as they move past him and away. 
Detective Hansen rises, takes him by the arm, and helps him 
to his feet.
HANSEN
Let's go, Scottie.
(Glares over at the 
Official grimly)
The son of a --
He purses his lips and starts Scottie toward the door. Gavin 
Elster moves toward them, and they meet, and have to stop. 
Hansen looks at Elster impassively.
ELSTER
Do you mind if I speak to him for a 
minute?
Receiving no answers he takes Scottie by the elbow.
ELSTER
Scottie --
He leads Scottie away toward the window. They stop.
ELSTER
Scottie, I'm sorry. That was rough.
Scottie finally looks up at him.
ELSTER
He had no right to say that. It was 
my responsibility. You didn't know 
her. I shouldn't have got you 
involved.
SCOTTIE
(struggling)
I -- I --
ELSTER
No, there's nothing you have to say 
to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For 
good. I can't stay here. I'm winding 
up her affairs, and mine. I'm going 
to get as far away as I can. Probably 
Europe. And I'll probably never come 
back.
(Extends his hand)
Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything 
I can do for you before I go...
Scottie looks at the outstretched hand, then looks up at the 
man's face, wanting very much to tell him how he felt about 
the dead woman. But the words won't come. Elster drops his 
hand with a sympathetic half-smile, and touches Scottie 
comfortingly on the arm.
ELSTER
There was no way for them to 
understand. But you and I know who 
killed Madeleine.
Elster and Scottie look at each other for a moment. Then 
Elster nods somberly and turns away and goes down the stairs 
with his attorney. The room is empty, now, but for Hansen 
and Scottie. Hansen, waiting near the doorway looks across 
to Scottie standing alone by the window. Beyond Scottie, 
through the window, we can see the cloister across the green.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. A CEMETERY SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO - ( DAY)
It is grey and deserted. In the distance a figure comes into 
views walking slowly, approaching a grave. It is Scottie.
EXT. A CEMETERY SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO - (DAY) - MEDIUM
SHOT
A closer view brings him to a stop before the grave, and he 
stares down at it impassively. The gravestone tells us it is 
Madeleine's grave.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - (NIGHT)
A foggy night, the city hidden in mist. The flash of beacons; 
fingers of fog; the spasmodic growls and ories of fog horns.
INT. SCOTTIE'S BEDROOM - (NIGHT)
Scottie in bed, sleeping restlessly. His head fills the 
screen, rolls from, side to side. In a SLOW DISSOLVE while 
his head remains on the screen, there comes into focus and 
is superimposed as it gets closer the head and shoulders of 
the portrait of Carlotta. The CAMERA PANS DOWN until it 
reveals the nosegay. The portrait is cleared from the screen, 
a new image is superimposed; the final scene at the inquest 
between Scottie and Gavin Elster. But this time, though it 
is not distinct, a woman's head can be discerned on Elster's 
shoulder. Elster turns to the woman and says: "Tell him he's 
not to blame; tell him." The woman turns her head to smile 
at Scottie. It is Carlotta Valdes again, dressed as in the 
portrait, with the necklace at her throats, and she is alive. 
The picture fades away. Scottie's restless head is alone on 
the screen again.
Another scene dissolves to the screen: the graveyard at 
Mission Dolores. The CAMERA IS APPROACHING the grave of 
Carlotta Valdes. Now we see Scottie approaching the grave. 
Now the CAMERA REVERSES, MOVING closer to the grave. It is 
open; there is a great black abyss, with the headstone to 
mark it.
A CLOSEUP OF SCOTTIE coming to a stop as he stares down. The 
black depths of the grave fill the screen, and now, suddenly 
we start to fall. A BIG CLOSEUP OF SCOTTIE, his hair 
windswept, staring down in horror as he falls. REVERSE ANGLE: 
he is still falling, but now from the tower of the Mission 
at San Juan onto the roof where Madeleine fell, and at the 
moment of impact the picture clears, and Scottie is sitting 
up in bed, staring ahead in horror, awakened by the sound of 
his own scream. The scream is echoed by a fog horn in the 
distance.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANITARIUM BEDROOM - (DAY)
We see a portable phonograph with a record on, and we hear 
Mozart at his gayest, most incisive, most sparkling. And 
then we find Midge standing nearby, smiling across at Scottie, 
who is seated in a wheelchair wearing a dressing gown over 
pajamas. His face is gaunt and expressionless. We are in a 
light and pleasant bed-sitting room. Through the window we 
can see a lovely garden, and a few patients accompanied by 
nurses strolling along the paths.
MIDGE
(Brightly)
It's Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus. I had 
a long talk with the lady in musical 
therapy, and she said Mozart's the 
boy for you, Johnny. The broom that 
sweeps the cobwebs away. That's what 
the lady said. You know, it's 
wonderful how they've got it all 
taped now, John. They've got music 
for melancholiacs, and music for 
dipsomaniacs, and music for 
nymphomaniacs... I wonder what would 
happen if somebody mixed up their 
files?
There is no reaction on Scottie's face, and Midge makes a 
grimace of dissatisfaction at the weakness of her joke. She 
looks across at him uncertainly.
MIDGE
But I brought you a lot of other 
things. You can see what you like. 
And the thing shuts off automatically.
She crosses to him swiftly kneels beside him.
MIDGE
Ah, Johnny, please try. Johnny, try! 
You're not lost. Mother's here.
No reaction. Long pause. Then we hear the door open.
Scottie does not seem to hear, but Midge turns her head. A 
nurse is looking in, with a significant look at Midge.
MIDGE
Time? Okay.
The nurse goes out. Midge rises.
MIDGE
I'll be in again, John. Do you want 
me to shut that off? It shuts off 
automatically.
Her eyes crinkle with anxiety. She nods and goes to the 
phonograph and shuts it off. She comes back to him slowly, 
and stands behind him, and puts her hands on his shoulders.
MIDGE
(Softly)
Ah, Johnny-O... you don't know I'm 
here, do you?
She leans down and kisses him lightly on the top of the head, 
and smiles gently.
MIDGE
But I'm here.
She moves to the door, going out of the SHOT, and we hear 
the door open and close. Scottie has not moved, his face 
does not change expression. His head bends down, and his 
gaze is fixed on the floor.
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SCOTTIE'S ROOM - (DAY)
Midge, walking down the corridor, meets the nurse near the 
open door of an office.
MIDGE
Could I see the doctor for a moment?
The nurse backs up a step and looks in the open doorway.
NURSE
Doctor...?
The Doctor looks up and sees Midge in the doorway.
DOCTOR
Oh. Yes, Miss Wood?
The nurse continues on up the corridor. Midge remains in the 
doorway.
MIDGE
Doctor, how long is it going to take 
you to pull him out of this?
DOCTOR
It is hard to say. Six months, at 
least. Perhaps a year. It depends to 
a certain extent on him.
MIDGE
He won't talk.
DOCTOR
No. We have ways of digging out 
knowledge. But it takes longer. He 
is suffering from acute melancholia, 
together with a guilt complex. He 
blames himself for what happened to 
the woman. And we know little of the 
background.
MIDGE
I can give you one thing: he was in 
love with her.
DOCTOR
Ah? That complicates the problem.
MIDGE
I'll give you another complication: 
he still is.
The Doctor studies her carefully.
MIDGE
And you know something, Doctor? I 
don't think Mozart's going to help 
at all.
She attempts a bright, gay smile but it comes out wrong. She 
turns and walks away down the corridor.

Once again a foggy night. The street lights ringed in the 
mist, and Coit Tower barely discernible in the distance. The 
fog horns sound.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
The living room, is mostly in shadow. One light in a far 
corner is lit. There is a fire in the fireplace, but it is 
almost burnt out, and casts only a faint glow.
An easy chair has been drawn up before the fire, and next to 
it is a small table on which is a bottle of whiskey, the 
remains of a highball, and an ashtray full of cigarette butts. 
There is no sign of life in the apartment. The telephone 
rings in the bedroom. It continues to ring.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ERNIE'S RESTAURANT, UPSTAIRS ROOM - (NIGHT)
Scottie is seated at the bar, exactly as he was the first 
time he saw Madeleine. The dinning room is crowded. Scottie's 
glance wanders about the room as he drinks, but he does not 
seem to be so much searching as waiting. And then he stiffens. 
From somewhere across the room a man and a woman are making 
their way among the tables toward the exit, and their relative 
positions as they move recall exactly the way Madeleine and 
Gavin Elster moved toward him on that night. And as the woman 
moves toward him, difficult to see clearly because of the 
movements of the waiters crossing her path, he could swear 
that it is Madeleine, and so could we. Although she does 
not wear an evening dress. Scottie stares, fearing and hoping 
as the woman gets closer and closer. And then she is there, 
and pauses near him to wait for the man, exactly as Madeleine 
did -- but it is not Madeleine.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BROCKLEBANK APARTMENTS - (DAY)
Scottie in the foreground, and across the street the apartment 
building from which Madeleine used to emerge, with the 
forecourt of cars. A long moment, then a man emerges and 
crosses the street and walks toward the Fairmont Hotel. 
Another wait, and then a woman comes out of the apartment 
house. She has Madeleine's figure and Madeleine's style. 
Scottie freezes. The woman crosses the forecourt toward a 
car out of our sight. Scottie moves to follow the course of 
the woman, and we move with him, and now the car comes into 
sight, it is the green Jaguar. The woman opens the car door. 
Scottie races across the street and into the forecourt. By 
the time he gets to the Jaguar, the woman is in behind the 
wheel and has the motor started. Scottie races up to her, 
then stops short. The woman is not like Madeleine in features, 
and is a good deal older. She looks up startled as Scottie 
comes to a stop by the open car window.
SCOTTIE
Where did you get this car?!
THE WOMAN
(Startled by his 
vehemence)
I beg your pardon?
SCOTTIE
This car...!!
THE WOMAN
Oh! Why... I bought it from a man 
who used to live here, in this 
apartment building. Mister Gavin 
Elster. I bought it from him when he 
moved away.
As Scottie stares at her, she grasps the connection.
THE WOMAN
0h! You know him! And his wife? The 
poor thing. I didn't know her. Tell 
me -- is it true that she really 
believed --
But by this time Scottie has turned and walked away, and she 
stares after him, a bit taken aback.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PALACE OF THE LEGION OF HONOR - (DAY)
Framed in the columns of the forecourt, Scottie wanders up 
the front walk and passes through the doors into the Art 
Gallery.
INT. PALACE OF THE LEGION OF HONOR - (DAY)
Scottie wanders to the entrance of the room in which hangs 
the Portrait of Carlotta, and stops and looks towards the 
far corner. Some people pass before him, but then as the 
vista clears he sees walking toward him from Carlotta's corner 
a woman who must surely be Madeleine. He stares, rigid, as 
she comes closer, and then she passes out of view as she 
heads for the exit. Scottie turns to keep her in sight, and 
as she passes through the doors to go out to the courtyard 
she turns a just a bit so that she is silhouetted slightly 
in profile against the cuter light, and once again surely it 
is Madeleine. Scottie heads for the door fast, pushes through 
the courtyard.
He breaks into a run and catches up with her and puts out 
his hand to take her arm, and as he does she turns, startled 
by his sudden appearance at her side -- and they both stop 
and stare at each other. It is not Madeleine. A moment, as 
the woman stares at him, frightened.
SCOTTIE
I'm sorry.
He turns away. The woman walks on.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PODESTA, BALDOCCHI - (LATE AFTERNOON)
Scottie stands before the window looking at the floral 
display. In the foreground is a group of madeup nosegays and 
one of them is exactly like the nosegay Madeleine carried to 
the grave, to the portrait, to the moment she threw herself 
into the Bay. A porter closes the shop door and locks it. A 
moment, then Scottie turns away to move down Grant Avenue. 
He stops short. Coming up Grant Avenue, headed for Sutter 
Street, is a group of shopgirls who have just come out of 
work, and among them is one who -- again -- must surely be 
Madeleine. Scottie watches them come closer, trying to get a 
clear view through the crowd of passersby, catching sight of 
the girl only in glimpses, and as the girls come abreast of 
him they stop to make their farewells. The one nearest to 
Scottie, seen in profile, might have the same features as 
Madeleine. He cannot be sure. This girl's hair is dark, where 
Madeleine's was light; her features on closer inspection 
seem heavier, and she wears much more makeup. And yet there 
is something about the way she carries herself. The other 
girls cross the street while the one nearest to Scottie goes 
on alone. He instinctively turns and follows.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SUTTER STREET NEAR LEAVENWORTH - (LATE AFTERNOON)
A trolley coach passes, heading west. The girl starts to 
cross the street in the middle of the block, waits for another 
trolley coach to pass, continues to the opposite side, and 
goes into the Empire Hotel, one of the typical inexpensive 
residential hotels of that neighborhood. Scottie remains on 
the opposite side of the street, watching, wondering what to 
do next.
He waits, and then, in much the same way it happened to him 
long ago at the McKittrick Hotel, his attention is attracted 
to a window on the second floor. The girl appears and opens 
the window about eight inches, then pulls down the blind. 
Scottie stares at the window, calculates in his mind the 
geographical position of the room, then starts across the 
street.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL JUDY'S HOTEL - (DUSK)
Scottie moves down the hall counting doors and comes to a 
stop. He knocks. The door opens, and the girl stands and 
looks at him, and waits. Scottie stares at her, searching 
for a sign of recognition, but there is none.
JUDY
Well? What is it?
Her voice is flat and slightly nasal, in sharp contrast to 
Madeleine's low, husky voice. Scottie winces slightly at the 
sound of it. He keeps staring at her for a moment. Then:
SCOTTIE
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
JUDY
What for? Who are you?
SCOTTIE
My name is John Ferguson, and --
JUDY
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or 
something?
SCOTTIE
No, there are just a few things I 
want to ask you, and --
JUDY
Do you live here in the hotel?
SCOTTIE
No, I happened to see you come in, 
and I thought --
JUDY
0h, I thought so! A pick-up! Well, 
you've got a nerve, following me 
right into the hotel and up to my 
room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
And she starts to close the door on him hard. Scottie holds 
it open against her.
SCOTTIE
No, please! I Just want to talk to 
you!
JUDY
(Pushing on the door)
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
SCOTTIE
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! 
Please!
She hesitates, impressed by the urgency in his voice.
SCOTTIE
Just let me talk to you.
JUDY
(Hesitating)
What about?
SCOTTIE
You.
JUDY
Why?
She is still holding on to the door, ready to slam it.
SCOTTIE
Because you remind me of someone.
She laughs a short, ironic, skeptical laugh.
JUDY
I've heard that one before, too. I 
remind you of someone you used to be 
madly in love with, but she ditched 
you for another guy, and you've been 
carrying the torch ever since, and 
then you saw me and something clicked.
(scornfully)
Huh!
SCOTTIE
(With a rueful smile)
You're not far wrong.
JUDY
Well, it's not going to work. So 
you'd better go.
SCOTTIE
Let me come in.
Her mouth drops open with shock at his effrontery.
SCOTTIE
You can leave the door open. Please. 
I want to talk to you.
A moment, then she backs into the room a little, and he 
follows.
JUDY
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
SCOTTIE
You won't have to.
JUDY
(Doubtfully)
Well... you don't look very much 
like Jack the Ripper...
But still she moves until she is next to the phone, her hand 
almost touching it. She eyes him carefully.
JUDY
What do you want to know?
SCOTTIE
Your name. And --
JUDY
Judy Barton.
SCOTTIE
Who you are --
JUDY
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
SCOTTIE
-- and how you happen to be living 
here.
JUDY
It's a place to live, that's all.
SCOTTIE
But you haven't lived here long.
JUDY
About three years.
SCOTTIE
No, a year ago! Where did you live a 
year ago!!?
JUDY
(Puzzled)
I told you! Right here!
SCOTTIE
(Strongly)
But before! Where did you live 
before!?!
JUDY
Salina, Kansas!
And that stops him dead, and he stares at her, denying.
JUDY
Listen, what is this? What do you 
want?
SCOTTIE
I want to know who you are.
JUDY
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! 
I come from Salina Kansas. I work at 
Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I 
have to prove it?
She moves swiftly to the dresser and rummages in her bag.
JUDY
You've got to prove you're alive 
these days! All right, Mister. My 
Kansas driver's license. Judy Barton. 
Number Z296794. Four-Twenty-Five 
Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas.
She pulls out another card: a California license. She hands 
it to him.
JUDY
There! See the address on this one? 
This place here! California License 
issued May 25, 1954! Want to check 
my thumb print? Satisfied.
(Pulls the card away)
And whether you're satisfied or not, 
you can just beat it!
A long moment as he stands before her, sagging a little 
defeated. She becomes remorseful and sympathetic.
JUDY
(Gently)
Gee, you have got it bad, haven't 
you? Do I really look like her?
He stares at her with an intensity that makes her crinkle 
her eyes in embarrassment.
JUDY
She's dead, isn't she.
An almost imperceptible nod.
JUDY
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I yelled at 
you.
He turns away slowly toward the door. His eyes fall on some 
framed photographs on the dresser and he pauses, then moves 
closer to see them clearly. One is of a girl about sixteen 
standing with a woman in her late thirties; they have their 
arms about each other; they both have dark hair. Scottie 
stares at it, then glances at Judy.
JUDY
Yes, that's me. With my mother.
Scottie's eyes move to another photograph, of a man in his 
early forties standing before a store. Above the store a 
sign says: A. M. BARTON, HARDWARES.
JUDY
That's my father. He's dead. My mother 
got married again... I didn't like 
the guy.
(Smiles, wistfully)
So... I decided to see what it was 
like in sunny California.
(Pause)
I've been here three years.
(she grins)
Honest!
He smiles back at her, liking her directness.
SCOTTIE
Will you have dinner with me?
JUDY
(Immediately wary, 
the smile fading)
Why?
SCOTTIE
Well, I feel I owe you something for 
all this...
JUDY
No, you don't owe me anything.
SCOTTIE
Then will you for me?
JUDY
(Warily)
Dinner... and what else?
SCOTTIE
Just dinner.
JUDY
Because I remind you of her?
SCOTTIE
Because I'd like to have dinner with 
you.
She smiles, pleased with the gallantry of his answer, and 
regards him thoughtfully.
JUDY
(Slowly)
Well... I've been on blind dates 
before... Matter of fact, to be 
honest, I've been picked up before.
(Grins)
Okay.
SCOTTIE
I'll get my car and be back in half 
an hour.
JUDY
Oh, no! Give me time to change and 
get fixed up!
SCOTTIE
An hour?
JUDY
Mmm.
SCOTTIE
Okay.
He flashes her a smile and goes, closing the door. She 
stares after him for a long moment, then moves slowly and 
sits down on the edge of the bed. She stares straight ahead, 
thinking, her face an impassive mask. The CAMERA MOVES IN 
until her head fills the screen, and her eyes are deep with 
dark memory. We DISSOLVE THROUGH to what she sees: THE MOMENT 
IN THE TOWER OF THE MISSION. MADELEINE IS RUNNING UP THE 
STAIRS OF THE TOWER: SCOTTIE STRUGGLING DESPERATELY AFTER 
HER. SHE REACHES THE TOP, OPENS THE DOOR, DARTS INTO THE 
BELL TOWER, SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND LOCKS IT. SHE TURNS. 
GAVIN ELSTER STANDS NEAR THE OPEN ARCH, HOLDING HIS WIFE 
FAST; SHE IS DRESSED IN A GREY SUIT EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE 
MADELEINE WEARS. HER BODY IS LIMP. SHE IS OBVIOUSLY DEAD 
ALREADY. ELSTER LOOKS AT MADELEINE, THEN PUSHES HIS WIFE OUT 
THROUGH THE ARCH. MADELEINE MAKES A FUTILE GESTURE TO STOP 
HIM, AND SCREAMS. ELSTER COMES TO QUICKLY, PUTS HIS HAND 
ACROSS HER MOUTH, AND DRAWS HER BACK INTO THE SHADOW BEHIND 
A MASONRY ABUTMENT. THEY ARE LOST FROM SIGHT...
DISSOLVE THROUGH to Judy, seated on the edge of her bed, 
staring with the memory of the horror of the moment. She 
sits very still. Then slowly she rises and moves to the 
window. She looks out, watching Scottie go down the street. 
She turns away and goes to the closet and opens the door. 
She pushes some clothes along the rack. We see the grey suit. 
She reaches into the closet and brings out a suitcase, lets 
it lie there, just outside the closet, and stares down at 
it. Then she turns back, goes to the writing desk sits down, 
and takes a sheet of paper. She picks up a ball point pen, 
clicks out the Point, stares ahead for a moment, then begins 
to write. As she writes, we hear her voice.
JUDY'S VOICE
Dearest Scottie ... and so you've 
found me. This is the moment I dreaded 
and hoped for, -- wondering what I 
would say and do if ever I saw you 
again, I wanted so to see you again. 
Just once. Now I'll go and you can 
give up your search.
(pause)
I want you to have peace of mind. 
You've nothing to blame yourself 
for. You were the victim. I was the 
tool, you were the victim of a man's 
plan to murder his wife. He chose me 
to play the part because I looked 
like her; he dressed me up like her. 
He was quite safe because she lived 
in the country and rarely came to 
town. He chose you to be the witness. 
The Carlotta story was part real, 
part invented to make you testify 
that Madeleine wanted to kill herself. 
He knew of your illness; he knew you 
would never get up the stairs of the 
tower. He planned it so well; he 
made no mistakes.
(pause)
I made the mistake. I fell in love. 
That wasn't part of the plan. I'm 
still in love with you, and I want 
you so to love me. If I had the nerve, 
I would stay and lie, hoping that I 
could make you love me again, as I 
am for myself... and so forget the 
other and forget the past. But I 
haven't the nerve to try...
She pauses and looks up and thinks, and wonders, and tries 
to see into the future, and as she does, the fear in her 
eyes dissolve into anxious hope, and then resolve.
She puts the pen down, rises slowly, takes up the letter and 
tears it into small pieces and drops the pieces into the 
wastebasket. She turns to the closet, pushes the suitcase 
back in with the toe of her foot, pushes the grey suit far 
back into darkness, and closes the closet door. She walks to 
the dresser, and stares at herself in the mirror. She opens 
a candy box in which we see trinkets and pieces of junk 
jewelry, and takes out two plain hoop earrings. She puts 
them on and looks to see how much change they make. She takes 
up an eyebrow pencil and slightly exaggerates the arch of 
her brows. She stares at herself impassively for a long time.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ERNIE'S RESTAURANT, UPSTAIRS ROOM - (NIGHT)
The room is filled with diners; waiters come and go. There 
is a sound of chatter and a slight clatter of dishes at a 
side table. We are looking from the bar, and at a table 
against the far wall we see Judy and Scottie, dining. They 
are talking amiable; Scottie is being genial and 
companionable, but there is no particular sense of intimacy. 
Judy looks about quite a bit, obviously admiring the room, 
and the food and the clothes of the people about her. She is 
dressed neatly, but more simply and more cheaply than are 
the other women in the room, and she is conscious of it, and 
keeps fiddling with the shoulders at her dress.
During this, a party of diners enters, is greeted by the 
captain, and is led across the room toward an empty table 
near Judy and Scottie. We go with them winding among the 
tables. As we get very close to Scottie, he looks up and 
becomes rigid, and stares. A woman has just gone by him to 
take seat at the neighboring table. Her hair is blonde and 
is done exactly as was Madeleine's; from the rear she could 
easily be Madeleine. But then she turns and sits down, 
glancing at Scottie as she does, and we see that it is not 
Madeleine. A moment, then Scottie looks away. Judy is staring 
at him anxiously. It is her first defeat and her first 
victory: defeat, in that although he is with her he is still 
searching; victory, in that she is sure, now, that he does 
not think she is Madeleine.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. JUDY'S HOTEL - (NIGHT)
Scottie's car drives up and comes to a stop. He gets out, 
comes around and opens the other door and helps Judy out. 
They stand there for a moment, then start for the front door.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. JUDY HOTEL, UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT)
Judy opens her door, flicks the light switch, and turns to 
Scottie in the doorway.
JUDY
Thank you again. Good-night.
SCOTTIE
Can I see you tomorrow?
JUDY
Tomorrow night? Well --
SCOTTIE
Tomorrow morning.
JUDY
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to 
work. I've got a job.
SCOTTIE
Don't go.
JUDY
(Smiling)
And what will I live on? My oil wells 
in Texas?
SCOTTIE
I'll take care of you.
JUDY
(Flatly)
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no 
thanks.
SCOTTIE
No, Judy, you don't understand.
JUDY
Oh, I understand, all right. I've 
been understanding since I was 
seventeen. And the next step is, as 
long as you're going to see me 
tomorrow, why don't you stay the 
night.
SCOTTIE
No.
JUDY
No? Then what?
SCOTTIE
I just want to see you as much as I 
can!
JUDY
As friends? We'd just see a lot of 
each other as friends, and you'd 
"take care of me"?
SCOTTIE
Yes.
JUDY
Why?
(No answer)
Because I remind you of someone?
(No answer)
That's not very complimentary.
(Pause)
And nothing would... happen...
SCOTTIE
No.
JUDY
That's not very complimentary, either.
She turns away and wanders into the room toward the window. 
She sits down in the chair to think it over, looking straight 
ahead, in profile to Scottie and to the window. Scottie stares 
at her, then suddenly reaches out and snaps off the light.
JUDY
(Frightened)
Listen, what'd you do that for?!?!
She starts to rise.
SCOTTIE
(Quickly)
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! 
Please! Stay in the chair!
JUDY
Why?!
SCOTTIE
Please! And don't look at me.
She subsides in the chair, and obeys, looking straight ahead 
again, holding very still, apprehensive. The only light in 
the room is from the street lamp outside, and it silhouettes 
Judy in profile, robbing her of hair-color, robbing her of 
makeup, and Scottie stares across at her, unsure, wishing he 
could persuade himself.
SCOTTIE
(Softly)
Will you, Judy?
JUDY
(Slowly, anxiously)
I suppose I could phone the store in 
the morning, and say I'm sick.
Another pause.
SCOTTIE
(Gently)
Good night, Judy.
He goes out, closing the door. Judy sits still, staring 
straight ahead. She raises a hand slowly and rubs the side 
of her face.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - (DAY)
It is a bright, sunny day. On a lovely green slope, young 
couples are stretched out making love. We see a pretty young 
girl sitting, and her young man lying on the grass at right 
angles with his head on her lap. She is playing with his 
hair. She bends down and kisses him.
The CAMERA MOVES ON, searching for Scottie and Judy, and 
comes upon another couple in a close embrace. The CAMERA 
MOVES ON and discovers Scottie and Judy strolling along the 
path at the foot of the slope. Judy is looking at the loving 
couples with wistful envy. Scottie is admiring the scenery 
in other direction. He holds a bag of popcorn. Judy looks 
up at him with gentle longing. He glances down at her and 
smiles companionably, and offers her the popcorn. She takes 
some and smiles back as well as she can.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. DANCE FLOOR, FAIRMONT HOTEL - (NIGHT)
The lighting in the room is low, the orchestra is playing 
"Isn't It Romantic", there are many couples on the floor, 
dancing romantically. It's romantic as hell. We find Scottie 
and Judy dancing, nicely, but rather sedately. Judy looks up 
at him once in a while, wishing she could get a bit closer, 
although he is not by any means keeping her at a distance.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. POST STREET, OUTSIDE GUMPS - (DAY)
There is a flower stand - known to all San Franciscans -- at 
the curb opposite the main entrance to Gumps, and Scottie 
and Judy have stopped there to pick a flower for her to wear. 
It is a bright, fresh morning. There is a display of corsages, 
made up, ready to wear. The Vendor stands beside them as 
they pick and choose. They seem quite happy.
JUDY
I like that one.
SCOTTIE
No, there. There's a good one. Do 
you like that?
JUDY
Yes --
The one Scottie has pointed out is remarkably like the nosegay 
in the portrait, though smaller and not an exact copy.
SCOTTIE
We'll take that one.
VENDOR
Very nice. And fresh. I just made it 
up.
He pins the nosegay on Judy.
VENDOR
That'll be a dollar four. Scottie 
pays him
JUDY
It's beautiful.
SCOTTIE
Okay. Now we're going to buy you 
some clothes.
JUDY
Honest?
He has started her across the middle of the street in the 
midst of traffic, and they have to run.
SCOTTIE
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the 
best. Come on.
JUDY
(Happy and breathless)
But Scottie, you don't have to!
SCOTTIE
I want to! Come on!
They go dodging across the street.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. RANSOHOFF'S - (DAY)
A spacious room on the second floor. Judy and Scottie are 
being waited on by a middle-aged saleswoman. A girl Assistant 
stands nearby. Draped about on neighboring chairs are several 
suits. Scottie looks tense. His jaw is set. Judy looks at 
him wonderingly. A model enters wearing a grey tweed suit, 
and parades before them.
SCOTTIE
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
SALESWOMAN
But you said grey, sir.
SCOTTIE
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, 
with a larger collar and belted.
(Indicates with hands)
He puts his hands to his waist.
JUDY
But I like that one, Scottie.
SCOTTIE
No, it's not right.
SALESWOMAN
(Cheerfully)
The gentleman seems to know what he 
wants.
(To the model)
All right. Well, we'll find it.
She goes and whispers to the Assistant, during the following, 
and the Assistant follows the model out.
JUDY
(Slightly apprehensive)
Scottie, what are you doing?
SCOTTIE
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
JUDY
But I loved the second one she wore.
And this one --
(She touches a suit 
on the chair)
-- is beautiful.
SCOTTIE
They're none of them right.
JUDY
But why?
The saleswoman has a sudden thought.
SALESWOMAN
Oh!! I think I know the suit you 
mean! We had it -- oh, it must be 
sometime ago! Let me go see. We may 
still have the model.
And she hurries away into the back room. Judy looks at Scottie 
with wondering, understanding eyes.
JUDY
You're looking for the suit she wore! 
For me?!?
Scottie looks at her anxiously, not wanting an argument.
JUDY
(Repelled)
You want me to dress like her?
SCOTTIE
Judy, I just want you to look nice. 
And I know what kind of suit would 
look well on you.
JUDY
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed 
like someone dead!
SCOTTIE
Judy --
JUDY
It's a horrible idea! Is that what 
I'm here for? To make you feel that 
you're with someone that's dead?
She has risen from her chair, appalled, and close to tears. 
The Saleswoman enters briskly.
SALESWOMAN
She'll be out in a moment.
SCOTTIE
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
JUDY
No, I won't do it!!
She walks away. Scottie follows her.
SCOTTIE
Judy!!
The saleswoman watches the altercation with interest. The 
two are out of earshot, now, but what they're seems pretty 
evident. 
Scottie is being urgently persuasive, Judy is staring at the 
floor, shaking her head, fighting the tears. The following 
is distant and blurred.
SCOTTIE
Judy, it can't make much difference 
to you. I just want to see how you'd 
look and I know it won't be the same, 
but --
JUDY
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't 
want anything! I want to get out of 
here!
SCOTTIE
(strongly)
Judy, you've got to do this for me! 
Please!
She looks up at him, frightened, and at that moment he sees 
the model enter, wearing the grey suit.
SCOTTIE
Yes! That's it!
SALESWOMAN
I thought so!
JUDY
I don't like it!
SCOTTIE
We'll take it! Will it fit?
SALESWOMAN
Oh, yes! It may need some slight 
alterations, but it is madam's size.
(To the model)
All right, dear.
(To Judy)
We'll have it for you to try in a 
moment.
SCOTTIE
How soon can it be altered?
SALESWOMAN
Well...
SCOTTIE
Can we have it by tonight?
SALESWOMAN
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
SCOTTIE
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at 
an evening dress, a dinner dress, 
black -- short -- long sleeves -- 
with a neck cut this...
(Indicates square 
neck)
...and the skirt out.
(Indicates full skirt 
with his hands)
JUDY
(Appealing)
Scottie --
He whirls on her with blazing eyes and stares at her 
commandingly, and Judy shrinks a little.
SALESWOMAN
(Laughs, embarrassed)
My, you certainly do know what you 
want, sir. I'll see what we have.
She goes into the back room. Judy and Scottie remains as 
they were, their eyes fixed on each other. But Judy is cowed.
DISSOLVE T0:
INT. RANSOHOFF'S, SHOE SALON - (DAY)
Open on a SHOT of Judy's legs, standing in new, high-heeled 
brown shoes. On the floor around her are other shoes and 
shoe boxes scattered haphazardly.
SCOTTIE'S VOICE
All right. Walk.
The legs start to walk, and the scene opens up as Judy walks 
away from the CAMERA, and we find Scottie seated, watching, 
and a shoe salesman in attendance. Judy sways a bit on the 
high heels in a way that could be reminiscent of Madeleine. 
She stops and turns, and stands staring at Scottie, without 
expression.
SCOTTIE
All right. That's it. Do you have in 
black, too?
SALESMAN
Yes, we have.
SCOTTIE
All right.
He looks at Judy and meets her gaze steadfastly.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SCOTTIE'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
In the living room. There is a fire in the fireplace. Judy 
is seated on the floor before the fire, bent forward with 
her head and arms buried in the seat of the easy chair. She's 
been crying. Scottie enters from the kitchen carrying a bottle 
of cognac and two glasses. He looks down at Judy, then pours 
cognac into the two glasses and sets the bottle down.
SCOTTIE
Here, Judy. Take it straight down. 
It's medicine.
Judy raises her tear-streaked face.
JUDY
(Pleading)
Why are you doing this? What good 
will it do?
She takes the glass from his outstretched hand.
SCOTTIE
I don't know. No good, I guess. But 
I don't know.
She takes a large sip of cognac, makes a face, and puts the 
glass away. As she does:
JUDY
(Tearfully)
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want 
to go away.
SCOTTIE
You can.
JUDY
No, you wouldn't let me.
(Then, almost to 
herself)
And I don't want to go...
Scottie comes down to her and puts his hands on her arms and 
holds her and looks into her eyes intently.
SCOTTIE
Judy, I want to tell you: these few 
days have been the first happy days 
I've had in a year.
JUDY
(Sadly)
I know. Because I remind you of her. 
The one that's dead. And not even 
that, very much.
SCOTTIE
(Meaning it)
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in 
you.
She looks at him with a new spark of hope, and her eyes are 
almost willing him to kiss her. But then he drops his hands 
from her arms, and the glow fades from her eyes, and she 
looks away.
JUDY
(Dully)
You don't even want to touch me.
SCOTTIE
(Grimly)
Yes. Yes, I do.
He rises and walks away toward the window. She looks after 
him, then rises and almost runs to him.
JUDY
Couldn't you like me, just me, the 
way I am?! When we first started out 
it was so good! We had fun! And you 
started on the clothes! I'll wear 
the darned clothes if you want me 
to! If you just like me!
They are face to face, and Scottie is studying her somberly. 
Beyond them, through the window, we can see that magnificent 
symbol, the Coit Tower.
SCOTTIE
(Studying)
The color of your hair...
JUDY
Ah, no!
SCOTTIE
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
She shrinks a little, and is defeated.
JUDY
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For 
you. And I can't do anything about 
it. I want you to love me. If I let 
you change me, will that do it? If I 
do what you tell me, will you love 
me?
SCOTTIE
Yes.
JUDY
All right. Then I'll do it. Because 
I don't care about me anymore. I 
just want you to love me.
Long pause.
SCOTTIE
(Gently)
I'll take you home.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ELIZABETH ARDEN SALON - (DAY)
The first impact is of SOUND, of the buzz of hair dryers and 
the shrill cacophony of female voices talking and laughing. 
Scottie is leaning at the doorway leading into the inner 
salon. The CAMERA PANS AWAY from him through another door 
and comes to REST on a big head of Judy, covered with, soap 
suds, bent over a basin. One of the beauty operators looks 
out toward Scottie then walks out to him.
OPERATOR
I'm afraid it's going to be several 
hours. The young lady thought perhaps 
you'd like to go home, and she'll 
come there as soon as she's finished.
SCOTTIE
Oh! Well... no. Tell her I'll go to 
her hotel, and wait for her there.
She starts to turns away. Scottie stops her.
SCOTTIE
Oh! You're sure about the color of 
the hair.
OPERATOR
0h, yes. It's an easy color.
SCOTTIE
And the rest of --
He waves a hand over his face.
OPERATOR
Yes, sir. We know what you want.
SCOTTIE
All right. Thanks.
He turns away after a last glance toward Judy. The last we 
see of the salon is Judy's head, as she turns to try to see 
through soap suds to where Scottie has been standing.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. JUDY'S BEDROOM, THE HOTEL - (DAY)
Scottie is wandering impatiently, smoking. Some of the 
Ransohoff boxes are piled in a corner. Then, abruptly he 
strides to the window. He looks, and becomes tense.
EXT. THE STREET - (DAY)
From Scottie's viewpoint. Judy is walking up the street. 
She wears the grey suit from Ransohoff's the high-heeled 
black shoes, and her hair is now blonde. But it hangs about 
her face in the usual way. She does not look up. She turns 
into the entrance of the hotel.
INT. BEDROOM - (DAY)
Scottie watches her until he loses sight of her directly 
below as she goes in the front door. He turns and looks looks 
toward the bedroom door and waits. Then, impatiently, he 
strides to the door and goes out into the corridor.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -(DAY)
Scottie looks along the corridor.
FROM HIS VIEWPOINT
The corridor is empty.
SCOTTIE
tensely waiting.
FROM HIS VIEWPOINT
Judy turns the corner, moving towards him.
AS SCOTTIE WATCHES CRITICALLY
Judy comes up to him. He backs into the room, Judy following.
INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - (DAY)
As Judy comes into the room, Scottie closes the door without 
taking his eyes from her. She looks at him gravely -- and 
holds out her hand, as though hoping for praise for the 
transformation. Her eyebrows have been plucked, her makeup 
lightened, her lipstick changed and she now bears much more 
of a resemblance to Madeleine.
JUDY
Well?
SCOTTIE
It should be back from your face --
with a bun at the neck. I told them. 
I told you.
JUDY
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Scottie abruptly goes to her, takes her hanging hair with 
both hands pulls it to the back so that her ears show. Judy 
looks at him, half-angry, half-scared.
Scottie, seeing the look in her eyes, takes his hands away. 
The hair falls forward again.
SCOTTIE
I'm sorry.
They look at one another for a moment. Then Scottie asks, 
almost humbly:
SCOTTIE
Judy -- please --
Judy doesn't answer for a moment, then she draws a deep 
breath, and turns resignedly away. She crosses to the mirror 
over a chest of drawers. Scottie matches as she picks up a 
couple of pins from a glass tray, and scoops up a handful of 
hair. Scottie stands watching in silence. His eyes follow 
every move. We hear the tinkle of pins of the glass tray.
FROM SCOTTIE'S VIEWPOINT
Judy slowly turns from the mirror to face him. She looks 
exactly like Madeleine -- her hair pulled back and done in a 
bun at the back of the neck. She stands there looking at 
him. SCOTTIE looks at her in wonder, his eyes shining. 
JUDY takes a step towards him, rewarded by his expression. 
SCOTTIE moves over and takes Judy in his arms.
BIG HEADS
of the two of them, together. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND the 
big heads. Scottie holds her tighter and tighter. He looks 
past her shoulder and we see that his eyes are closed, because 
at last he holds Madeleine in his arms once more. He opens 
his eyes -- the CAMERA SWIMS AROUND the room.
WE ARE NOW IN THE LIVERY STABLE AT SAN JUAN BAUTISTA
with Scottie holding Madeleine tight in his arms, kissing 
her. We see this for only the briefest moment before it
DISSOLVES AWAY T0:
BACK IN THE HOTEL ROOM
Scottie kisses her as he did in the livery stables. As he 
kisses her, and she turns his kiss, the CAMERA PULLS BACK 
SLOWLY and their two figures are held in the center of the 
room.
DISSOLVE T0:
INT. JUDY'S BEDROOM - (EARLY EVENING)
The window shades are drawn, the lights in the room have 
been lit. Scottie is sitting, relaxed, thumbing through a 
magazine idly. The jacket of his suit is hung over the back 
of a chair. The bathroom door is open. There is a full length 
mirror on the back of the bathroom door, and we catch 
occasional glimpses of Judy as she moves about inside. 
Scottie looks up as she calls to him. Her voice is light and 
happy.
JUDY
Where shall we go for dinner?
SCOTTIE
Wherever you'd like...
JUDY
Ernie's?
SCOTTIE
You've got a thing about Ernie's, 
haven't you?
JUDY
Well, after all, it's "our place."
She comes out of the bathroom happy and contented. She wears 
the black cocktail dress, her blonde hair is done up in the 
Madeleine way. She stops to pose and show off the dress and 
smiles across at him lovingly.
JUDY
Hello, my love. Like me?
He regards her admiringly with a small, contented grin.
SCOTTIE
Mmmm.
JUDY
Is that the best you can do?
She turns to the mirror over the dresser.
SCOTTIE
Come here.
JUDY
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
SCOTTIE
That's what I had in mind.
JUDY
Too late. I've got my face on.
She has opened the candy box, rummages around in the jewelry, 
comes up with some earrings, holds one up to her ear to see 
what it looks like, decides against it, finds some other 
earrings, small and neat, and puts them on. During this:
JUDY
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather 
go somewhere else?
SCOTTIE
No, Ernie's is fine.
JUDY
I'm going to have one of those big 
beautiful steaks. And... let's see... 
to start...
During this she has taken a necklace out of the box, and is 
trying to fasten it around her neck. But the clasp won't 
work.
JUDY
Oh! Help me with this, will you?
She backs up a step, still holding the necklace in place, 
and Scottie rises from his chair and comes up in back of 
her. He takes the ends of the necklace from her.
SCOTTIE
I've got it. He bends down and bites 
the back of her neck.
JUDY
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it! 
SCOTTIE
All in good time.
He bites her again.
JUDY
Scottie!
SCOTTIE
How does it work?
JUDY
Can't you see?
SCOTTIE
Oh, yeah. There.
As he is fastening it he glances into the mirror and sees 
the necklace clearly for the first time. His eyes are 
immediately startled with the shock of recognition, and he 
stares, wondering why. The CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a closeup of 
the necklace in the mirror; then, with a click, the closeup 
changes to a closeup of the necklace painted on canvas. The 
CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show the necklace around the neck of 
Carlotta in the portrait, the same necklace. Now the CAMERA 
DRAWS BACK to show the Art Gallery, with the Portrait of 
Carlotta on the far wall. The scene click-changes to a BIG 
HEAD of SCOTTIE, staring, and during this we hear Judy 
chattering away.
JUDY'S VOICE
Thank you, darling. Now I'm just 
about ready; I just have to find my 
lipstick. Where did I put it? I had 
it a minute ago.
(Her voice fading)
Did I leave it in here? Oh, yes, 
here it is!
(Her voice fading in)
All right, I'm ready.
His eyes move in the direction of the voice, and now we see 
her, standing a few feet from him, smiling at him. She walks 
to him with a loving smile.
JUDY
But first... muss me a little.
She puts her arms around him and presses against him, and 
lays her head against his chest with a happy sigh.
JUDY
Ah, Scottie... I do have you, now...
He raises his arms as though to embrace her, moves his hands 
to her shoulders, and one senses for a moment that he is 
going to press her too hard or that he may move his hands to 
her throat. But then he lays his hands gently on her back, 
and closes his eyes wearily, and rests his head on the top 
of hers.
SCOTTIE
(Softly)
How would you like to go somewhere 
out of town for dinner? Drive down 
the peninsula, somewhere?
She moves her head, and he raises his and opens his eyes, 
and she smiles up at him.
JUDY
All right, if you'd like.
She reaches up and kisses him briefly on the mouth. He smiles 
a small, enigmatic smile.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT: HIGHWAY 101 - (NIGHT) - LONG SHOT
Scottie's car headed south, in brilliant moonlight.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT)
Scottie at the wheel, Judy alongside. She glances at him, 
wondering.
JUDY
We're going awfully far.
SCOTTIE
I feel like driving. Are you terrible 
hungry?
JUDY
No, it's all right.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - (NIGHT)
Scottie's car enters the avenue of tall trees we saw once 
before along this road. They look sinister in the moonlight.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT)
Shooting forward, we are as though in the front seat of 
Scottie's car, traveling fast, looking up and ahead to the 
distant end of the tunnel, and the tall trees flashing by.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT)
Scottie is staring straight ahead, concentrating on his 
driving. Judy is staring up at the tall trees, wondering, 
her brow furrowed. Her memory is stirred, but she can't think 
why.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT)
Shooting forward and up through the windshield. The tops of 
the tall trees flashing past. Judy's face, highlighted from 
the dash lights below, faintly reflected.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT
Judy turns her gaze from the flashing tree tops and looks 
off at Scottie.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT
Scottie, still concentrating on his driving, and looking 
straight ahead.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT)
Judy looking at Scottie, puzzled and slightly apprehensive.
JUDY
Where are you going?
SCOTTIE
(wryly)
To complete my cure.
He glances at her and smiles nicely.
SCOTTIE
One final thing I have to do, and 
then I'll be rid of the past, forever.
He looks ahead thoughtfully.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT: MISSION SAN BAUTISTA - (NIGHT) - LONG HIGH SHOT
Quiet, empty, sinister, bathed in moonlight. Far below we 
see Scottie's car crawl into the square and pass along the 
road around the green and come to a stop near the entrance 
to the church. A distant church clock chimes the half-hour.
INT. SCOTTIE'S CAR - (MOONLIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT
Judy's face, rigid, frightened, her eyes filled with 
apprehension. Then, with an effort, she composes herself and 
glances at Scottie with calm questioning. But he is turned 
away from her, opening his door to get out.
EXT. SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (NIGHT)
Scottie comes around the car and opens Judy's door.
JUDY
Scottie, why are we here?
SCOTTIE
I told you. I have to go back into 
the past. Once more. For the last 
time.
JUDY
But why? Why here?
SCOTTIE
Madeleine died here.
Pause.
He holds out his hand. She shrinks, frightened.
JUDY
No, I don't want to go. I want to 
stay here.
SCOTTIE
I need you.
JUDY
Why?
SCOTTIE
I can't do it alone. I need you, to 
be Madeleine for a while. Then, when 
it's done, we'll both be free.
He draws her out of the car.
JUDY
I'm scared.
SCOTTIE
So am I, But it has to be done. I 
have to tell you about Madeleine, 
now.
He closes the car door and leads her slightly away, and they 
stop and look across the green toward the Livery Stable.
SCOTTIE
There...
He points to the Livery Stable, bathed in moonlight.
SCOTTIE
...We stood there and I kissed her 
for the last time. And she said, "If 
lose me, you'll know that I loved 
you --
JUDY
(Pleading)
Scottie --
SCOTTIE
(Going right on)
-- and wanted to go on loving you." 
And I said, "I won't lose you."
(pause)
But I did.
He turns slowly, and Judy with him, and he looks up. Her 
eyes follow his.
FROM THEIR ANGLE
The high church tower in the moonlight.
SCOTTIE'S VOICE
She turned and ran... into the 
Church...
SCOTTIE AND JUDY
He puts his arm around her protectively but firmly, and begins 
to impel her gently to the church.
EXT. CHURCH, SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (MOONLIGHT)
SHOOTING from the door. Scottie impels Judy to the door.
SCOTTIE
...And when I followed her, it was 
too late...
The CAMERA PULLS AROUND as his tree hand goes to try the 
door.
JUDY
(Frightened)
I don't want to go in there!
Scottie pushes the door open.
SCOTTIE
...too late...
He pushes her into the church with gentle firmness.
INT. CHURCH, SAN JUAN BAUTISTA - (NIGHT)
The darkness is relieved by shafts of moonlight. Scottie 
impels Judy toward the foot of the tower.
SCOTTIE
I couldn't find her. Then I heard 
her footsteps on the stairs, she was 
running up the tower.
INT. CHURCH TOWER - (NIGHT)
It is lit by shafts of moonlight through the slit window. 
Scottie comes into the area holding Judy. He looks up.
FROM SCOTTIE'S ANGLE:
the open stairway spiraling upward.
SCOTTIE'S VOICE
She ran up those stairs... and through 
the door at the top of the tower, 
and locked it behind her. Then she 
jumped.
BACK TO SCOTTIE AND JUDY
He is still staring up. Judy is rigid with fright and the 
memory of that moment.
SCOTTIE
And I couldn't follow her.
(He closes his eyes 
in the agony of 
remembering)
God knows I tried.
(He glances down)
One doesn't often get a second chance. 
I want to stop being haunted. You're 
my second chances, Judy.
JUDY
(A frightened whisper)
Take me away...
SCOTTIE
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up 
the stairs.
JUDY
No!
SCOTTIE
Go up the stairs, Judy.
(Pushing her to the 
step)
I'll follow.
She starts up slowly, unwillingly. Scottie follows behind 
her, fighting to keep the impending vertigo under control, 
trying to keep his eyes fixed on her back to avoid looking 
up into space. They move up in silence, and in shadow, their 
faces occasionally lit by the shafts of moonlight that stream 
through the open arches of the tower. Judy's eyes are wide 
and staring; her face and body are stiff with the struggle 
to keep from breaking under the strain of remembering the 
last time she went up these stairs. And Scottie fights his 
way up behind her.
Judy slows down and comes to a halt at the landing that 
Scottie barely reached the last time, at the moment of death. 
She leans her back against the wall for support. Scottie 
struggles up and comes to a halt near her.
PAUSE, as he gathers himself for the last assault.
SCOTTIE
(Quietly)
This was as far as I could get. But 
you went on. Remember?
She stiffens and stares at him.
SCOTTIE
The necklace, Madeleine. That was 
the slip. I remembered the necklace.
A moment, then suddenly she ducks and tries to run past him, 
down the stairs. He grabs her wrist and holds on.
SCOTTIE
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
JUDY
No! Let me go!
SCOTTIE
We're going up the tower.
JUDY
You can't. You're afraid!
SCOTTIE
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
He starts to drag her up the stairs and she fights it, close 
to hysteria.
JUDY
Scottie, please...!
SCOTTIE
But you knew, that day, that I 
wouldn't be able to follow you didn't 
you. Who was at the top when you got 
there? Elster? With his wife?
JUDY
Yes!
SCOTTIE
And she was the one who died. Not 
you. The real wife. You were the 
copy, you were the counterfeit. Was 
she dead or alive when you got there?
JUDY
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
SCOTTIE
Took no chances, did he? And when 
you got there, he pushed her off the 
tower, was that it? But you were the 
one who screamed. Why did you scream?
JUDY
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to 
stop it --
SCOTTIE
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well 
up to then?!! You played his wife so 
well, Judy! He made you over, didn't 
he? Just as I've done. But better! 
Not just the hair and the clothes! 
the look! the manner! the words! 
Those beautiful phony trances! That 
jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're 
really a strong swimmer, aren't you! 
Aren't you!!
The blind, frantic nodding of her head as she struggles 
against him is his affirmation.
SCOTTIE
Did he train you? Rehearse you? 
Teach you what to say and what to 
do?
JUDY
Yes!
SCOTTIE
And you were such an apt pupil! What 
fun you two must have had, playing 
games with me! Why me? Why did he 
pick on me?!!
JUDY
Your accident...
SCOTTIE
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the 
made-to-order witness. Where is he 
now?
JUDY
I don't know... Switzerland?
SCOTTIE
We'll find him.
They have reached the door to the tower and he stops, with a 
grim, almost triumphant smile.
SCOTTIE
I made it.
JUDY
(Apprehensive)
What are you going to do?
SCOTTIE
Look at the scene of the crime. Go 
on in.
He pushes the door open. She shrinks back.
SCOTTIE
Go on!
He pushes her through and follows her in.
INT. BELL TOWER - (NIGHT)
The black shadows are cut by shafts of moonlight. Heavy beams 
support the great bell hanging at the center. There are 
additional temporary support beams. Judy backs up against 
the stonework as Scottie looks about.
SCOTTIE
You both hid behind there, mmm?... 
'til everything was clear... then 
sneaked down and drove back to the 
city.
(Glances at her)
And then? You were his girl. What 
happened to you?
She stares at him, wide-eyed with apprehension.
SCOTTIE
Did he ditch you?
An almost imperceptible nod from her. Scottie almost laughs.
SCOTTIE
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, 
and the freedom and the power... he 
ditched you? What a shame! But he 
knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. 
Didn't he give you anything?
JUDY
(Faintly)
Some money.
SCOTTIE
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. 
That was your mistake, Judy. One 
shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. 
You shouldn't have been that 
sentimental.
A moment, as he stares at her, then he advances on her slowly.
JUDY
(Apprehensive)
What are you going to do?
SCOTTIE
I loved you, Madeleine.
JUDY
(Desperately)
I was safe when you found me, there 
was nothing you could prove! But 
when I saw you again I couldn't run 
away, I loved you so! I walked into 
danger and let you change me again 
because I loved you and wanted you!
(She throws herself 
into his arms)
Scottie, please! You love me now! 
Love me! Keep me safe!
And she is in his arms, pressing tightly against him in 
desperation, and he holds her tight, and they kiss, deeply, 
passionately. The kiss ends but they remain together, holding 
together, and Scottie's eyes are tight with pain and the 
emotion of hating her and hating himself for loving her.
JUDY
(softly, pleading)
Love me... keep me safe...
SCOTTIE
(Whispering)
Too late... too late... there's no 
bringing her back.
Suddenly Judy's eyes, looking past him, go wide with horror.
FROM JUDY'S POINT OF VIEW
The figure of a woman draped in black stands motionless in 
the shadows by the door.
JUDY, IN SCOTTIE'S ARMS, TRANSFIXED
FROM JUDY'S POINT OF VIEW
The black figure moves forward, seems to merge with the shadow 
and become part of them.
JUDY
Pulls out of Scottie's arms and backs away, terrified.
JUDY
(Whispering)
No... no...
She is backing perilously close to the edge of the drop below. 
Scottie stares at her for a moment, then swings around to 
see what she is looking at.
FROM SCOTTIE'S POINT OF VIEW
The black figure advances into a shaft of moonlight. It is a 
nun.
THE NUN
(Simply)
I heard voices...
There is a terrible scream. Scottie swings around again, 
steps quickly to the edge and looks down. He backs away, his 
face tight with horror and holds the stonework for support. 
The nun comes into the SHOT. She steels herself to look below. 
She crosses herself.
THE NUN
God have mercy...
She reaches out for the bell cord.
INT. THE BELL TOWER - (NIGHT)
The church bell is tolling. It swings in and out of the 
picture. Through the archway we can see the Mission garden 
below. Figures are hurrying across toward the church.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. MIDGE APARTMENT - (NIGHT)
Midge is huddled in a chair, listening to the radio. Beyond 
her, San Francisco at night.
THE RADIO
-- was last heard of living, but is 
now thought to be residing somewhere 
in the south of France. Captain Hansen 
states that he anticipated no trouble 
in having Elster extradited once he 
is found. Other news on the local 
front: in Berkeley three university 
of California sophomores found 
themselves in a rather embarrassing 
position tonight when they were 
discovered by Police Officer William 
Fogarty leading a cow up the steps 
of --
By now Midge has heard the NOISE outside, has uncoiled from 
the chair and shut the radio. She listens again for a moment, 
then moves quickly to the table on which are bottles, glasses 
and ice. She starts to mix a strong highball and does not 
turn as she hears the front door open. Scottie enters and 
closes the door behind him. His face is a mask.
He moves slowly across the room and stands by the window, 
with the view of San Francisco beyond him, and looks straight 
ahead, thinking. Midge picks up the highball, glances over 
at him, picks up the bottle and pours in another slug. Then 
moves across the room and holds out the drink. Scottie takes 
it. Midge moves away, picks up her own drink, sits down and 
looks across the room. Scottie stands quietly, immobile, 
then raises the glass and takes a long pull at the drink. He 
stares out at the city.
FADE OUT:
THE END
FADE IN:
FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the
people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the
policemen directing traffic.
PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS
waiting at street corner for light to change.
CLOSE SHOT - MAN
at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the
sky.
TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM
as she follows his gaze upward.
LONG SHOT - THE SKY
with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.
MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER
as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd
walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling
gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:
MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS
in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.
She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed,
exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick
sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride,
a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the
front door of a pet shop and enters.
INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT
Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back
toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.
MacGRUDER, comes toward her.
MELANIE
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever
seen so many gulls?
MRS. MACGRUDER
Hello, Miss Daniels.
MELANIE
What do you suppose it is?
MED. SHOT
Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is
BARKING, o.s.
MRS. MACGRUDER
(shaking her head)
There must be a storm at sea. That
can drive them inland, you know.
They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird
department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor
of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie
and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end. There
is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls
are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so
that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained
birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic
birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages,
larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets
in the bigger cages. As they walk:
MRS. MACGRUDER
I was hoping you'd be a little late,
Miss Daniels.
(apologetically)
You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
MELANIE
You said three o'clock.
MRS. MACGRUDER
I know. Oh, I know.
(she is more distressed
now)
I've been calling all morning. Oh,
you have no idea. Miss Daniels,
they're so difficult to get, really
they are. We get them from India,
you know, when they're just little
chicks, and then we have to...
MELANIE
Well, this one won't be a chick,
will he?
MRS. MACGRUDER
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly
not. This will be a full grown myna
bird. Full grown.
MELANIE
And he'll talk?
MRS. MACGRUDER
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no.
You'll have to teach him to talk.
MELANIE
Yes.
MRS. MACGRUDER
Yes.
(pause)
Oh my, I suppose I should call them
again. They said three o'clock.
(pause)
Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.
Would you mind waiting?
MELANIE
(judiciously)
I think maybe you'd better deliver
him. Let me give you my address.
(she begins taking
off her gloves)
MRS. MACGRUDER
(producing pencil and
pad)
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
As Melanie starts writing:
MRS. MACGRUDER
I'm sure they're on the way, though.
Could I just call?
MELANIE
(with a resigned sigh)
Well, all right, but...
She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. Melanie
finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the
counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.
MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at
Davidson's.
(pause; accusingly)
It's past three, you know.
(pause)
Well, how long do you think...? All
right, would you check it please?
Yes, I'll wait.
Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter,
she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips
with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding
her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the
bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins
BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.
MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER
as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the
steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about
twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt
hat.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of
strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.
The birds are startled into scarlet flight.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little
nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes
her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and
then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of
the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.
MITCH
I wonder if you could help me.
MELANIE
What?
MITCH
(deliberately, and
with a touch of
hauteur)
I said I wonder if you could help
me.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to
inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But
then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea
comes to her.
MELANIE
(solicitously)
Yes, what was it you were looking
for, sir?
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MITCH
(deadpan)
Lovebirds.
MELANIE
Lovebirds, sir?
MITCH
Yes. I understand there are different
varieties, it that true?
MELANIE
Well... yes, sir, there are.
MITCH
These are for my sister... her
birthday you see. As she'll be eleven
and... well, frankly, I wouldn't
want a pair of birds that were too
demonstrative.
MELANIE
I understand completely, sir.
MITCH
As the same time, I wouldn't want
birds that were aloof, either.
MELANIE
(leading him around
shop)
No, of course not.
MITCH
Do you have a pair that are just
friendly?
MELANIE
I think so, sir.
(she looks around)
Now then, let me see.
MITCH
(at the finches)
Aren't these lovebirds?
MELANIE
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
MITCH
The sign says strawberry finches.
MELANIE
(airily)
Yes, we call them that too.
(she moves away)
Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
(and stops before a
cage of canaries)
MITCH
Those are canaries, Miss.
(pause)
Doesn't this make you feel awful?
MELANIE
(baffled)
Doesn't what make me...?
MITCH
All these innocent little creatures
caged up like this?
MELANIE
Well, we can't just let them fly
around the shop, you know.
MITCH
I suppose not. Is there an
ornithological reason for keeping
them in separate cages?
MELANIE
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the
species.
MITCH
I imagine that's very important.
Especially during the moulting season.
MELANIE
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous
time.
MITCH
Are they moulting now?
MELANIE
Some of them are.
MITCH
How can you tell?
MELANIE
Well... they get a sort of hangdog
expression.
CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.
The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.
MITCH
Yes, I see.
(pause)
About those lovebirds, Miss...
MELANIE
Are you sure you wouldn't like to
see a canary instead? We have some
very nice canaries this week.
MITCH
All right.
(he smiles)
She smiles back.
MITCH
(he waits)
All right, may I see one, please?
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries
out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter
where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily,
and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary
cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.
MELANIE
(feebly)
Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.
One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and
into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.
MELANIE
Oh! Ohhhhh!
FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and
Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter,
finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all
day.
MRS. MACGRUDER
What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the
birds is loose!
She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up
to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches
them suspiciously.
MITCH
Shhh! Shhhh!
He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers
the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
the canary in his hand.
MELANIE
There we are!
MRS. MACGRUDER
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the
door.
MITCH
(putting the canary
in)
Back into your gilded cage, Melanie
Daniels.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
startled.
MELANIE
What did you say?
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MITCH
(savoring this)
I was merely drawing a parallel,
Miss Daniels.
MELANIE
But how... how do you know my name?
MITCH
(secretly)
A little birdie told me.
(he smiles politely)
Good day, Miss Daniels.
(he bows to Mrs.
MacGruder)
Madam.
(he starts out)
MELANIE
Hey, wait a minute!
She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her
bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:
MELANIE
I don't know you.
MITCH
Ahhh, but I know you.
MELANIE
How?
MITCH
We met in court.
MELANIE
We never met in court or anyplace
else.
MITCH
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw
you in court.
MELANIE
When?
MITCH
Do you remember one of your practical
jokes that resulted in the smashing
of a plate glass window?
MELANIE
I didn't break that window!
MITCH
No, but your little prank did. The
judge should have put you behind
bars!
MELANIE
What are you? A policeman?
MITCH
I simply believe in the law, Miss
Daniels, and I'm not too keen on
practical jokers.
MELANIE
What do you call your lovebird story
if not a practical...
MITCH
Ahhh, but I really do want those
birds.
MELANIE
You knew I didn't work here. You
deliberately...
MITCH
Right. I recognized you when I came
in. I thought you might like to know
what it felt like to be on the other
end of a gag. What do you think of
that, Miss Daniels?
MELANIE
I think you're a louse.
MITCH
I am.
(he tips his hat)
Good day.
(to Mrs. MacGruder)
Madam.
(and he goes down the
steps)
MELANIE
And I'm glad you didn't get your
lovebirds!
MITCH
(breezily, as he goes
out)
I'll find something else.
(he gives a slight
bow)
See you in court some day.
The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.
MELANIE
(angrily)
That... that... who was that?
MRS. MACGRUDER
I have no idea.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She
looks through the glass.
LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
getting into his car at the curb.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
looking after the car at the curb.
CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She
begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE

MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.
as she comes up to the counter.
MELANIE
Have you got a pencil?
MRS. MACGRUDER
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
As Melanie begins writing:
MRS. MACGRUDER
They said the myna bird would be
here later this afternoon. If you'd
care to come back...
MELANIE
No, you'd better send him. May I use
your phone?
MRS. MACGRUDER
(bewildered by
everything)
Yes, certainly.
(she puts phone on
counter)
MELANIE
(as she dials)
Do you have any lovebirds?
MRS. MACGRUDER
No, not in the shop. But I can order
them for you.
MELANIE
How soon?
MRS. MACGRUDER
Well... well, how soon would you
want them?
MELANIE
Immediately.
(into phone)
Is this the Daily News? Melanie
Daniels. Would you get me the city
desk, please?
MRS. MACGRUDER
I might be able to have them by
tomorrow morning. Would that be all
right?
MELANIE
(with an edged anger)
That would be just fine.
(into phone)
Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I
want you to do a favor for me.
(pause)
No, this is a small one.
(pause)
Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling,
would I try to pressure you? Will
you call the Department of Motor
Vehicles for me and find out who
owns this license plate? DKQ dash
one seven six.
(pause)
Yes, a California plate.
(pause)
No, I'll stop up there in a little
while. Is daddy in his office?
(pause)
Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in
on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see
him later. Thank you, Charlie.
(she hangs up)
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.
MELANIE
Now. What time tomorrow morning?
FADE IN:
FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR
pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She
glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around
to the other side, and opens the door.
CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses
in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.
CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND
running down the list of names slowly. It stops.
INSERT - THE CARD
her finger beside it.
BRENNER, M. 3B
CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she
runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then
does the same for the next column.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby,
grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.
REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE
coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly
toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing,
waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with
answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the
elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The
elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows
her to enter first. She does so with a small nod. The
elevator doors close.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR
The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and
Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander
down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him. Self-
consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds.
The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The
doors begin to open.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is
right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The
man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in
front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn
the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment
just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key.
He looks at Melanie.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
smiling at him feebly.
FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR
The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm
of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie
watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down
before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND
reaching into the purse for a white envelope.
INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE
written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly
goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.
MAN'S VOICE
Miss...? She stops, distressed.
FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR
the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other
end, near the elevator.
MAN
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
MELANIE
(curtly)
Yes.
MAN
He's not home.
MELANIE
That's all right.
She presses button for the elevator.
MAN
He won't be back until Monday. I
mean, if those birds are for him....
MELANIE
Monday?
MAN
Yes. I don't think you should leave
them in the hall, do you?
MELANIE
(trapped)
Well, I...
The elevator doors open.
MELANIE
Well, where did he go?
MAN
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every
weekend.
MELANIE
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
MAN
Up on the coast. About sixty miles
north of here.
MELANIE
Sixty...
(her face falls)
Oh.
MAN
About an hour and a half on the
freeway. Or two if you take the coast
highway.
MELANIE
Oh.
MAN
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm
going away myself. Someone's got to
feed them, I suppose.
MELANIE
(in utter despair now)
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
MAN
(apologetically)
I'm awfully sorry.
He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes
inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to
look at the birds.
LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down
the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks
up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds
are COOING and CHIRPING madly.
MELANIE
Oh, shut up!
And she steps into the elevator.
DISSOLVE
FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)
on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day,
with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow
should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the
ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged
birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL
SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
She turns wheel forcefully.
CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one
side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car
rounds the curve.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
at the wheel, she glances out toward the bay.

RADIO AND TELEVISION.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

LONG SHOT - THE TIDES
past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the
docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)
studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.
FULL SHOT - THE TOWN
through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life
in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with
their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.
This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is --
is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's
P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO
BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the
door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling
suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks
quickly toward the front door.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
enters post office.
CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK
behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out
a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not
look up as she approaches.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
through the bars of the cage.
MELANIE
Good morning.
CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK
CLERK
(without looking up)
Morning.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK
MELANIE
I wonder if you could help me.
CLERK
Try my best.
MELANIE
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell
Brenner.
CLERK
Yep.
He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.
MELANIE
Do you know him?
CLERK
Yep.
MELANIE
Where does he live?
CLERK
Right here. Bodega Bay.
MELANIE
Yes, but where?
CLERK
Right across the bay there.
MELANIE
Where?
It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he
leaves the window.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
through the bars, exasperated.
REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE
as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's
vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the
Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches
him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if
he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock
still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then
that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither
speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at
her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends
his arm and points.
CLERK
See where I'm pointing?
MELANIE
Yes?
FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)
CLERK (O.S.)
See them two big trees across there?
MELANIE (O.S.)
Yes?
CLERK (O.S.)
And the white house?
MELANIE (O.S.)
That's where the Brenners live.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK
MELANIE
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
CLERK
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
MELANIE
The two kids?
CLERK
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
MELANIE
I see. How do I get down there?
CLERK
Follow the road straight through
town 'til it curves off on the left.
That'll take you right around the
bay to their front door.
MELANIE
The front door.
(pause)
Isn't there a back road I can take?
CLERK
Nope. That's the road. Straight
through town, stay on your left,
right around the bay to the front
door.
MELANIE
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
CLERK
Mmmm.
MELANIE
I didn't want to come right down the
road, where they could see me.
CLERK
Mmmm.
MELANIE
It's a surprise, you see.
CLERK
Mmmmmm.
(long pause)
'Course, you could get yourself a
boat, cut right across the bay with
it. The Brenners got a little dock
there you could tie up at. If that's
what you wanted to do.
MELANIE
Where would I get a boat?
CLERK
Down at the dock by the Tides
Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard
boat?
MELANIE
(looking at him)
Of course.
CLERK
(looks back at her)
D'you want me to order one for you?
MELANIE
(surprised)
Thank you.
CLERK
What name?
MELANIE
Daniels.
CLERK
Okay.
He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the
bay.
FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for
the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up
and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns
back toward the post office.
INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT
as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy,
still does not look up.
MELANIE
I wonder if you could tell me...
CLERK
Yep?
MELANIE
The little girl's name.
CLERK
The little Brenner girl?
MELANIE
Yes.
CLERK
Alice, I think.
(he turns, shouts to
someone in rear)
Harry, what's the little Brenner
girl's name?
HARRY'S VOICE
(shouting)
What?
CLERK
(shouting)
The little Brenner girl.
HARRY'S VOICE
(shouting)
Lois!
CLERK
(shouting)
It's Alice, ain't it?
HARRY'S VOICE
(shouting)
No, it's Lois!
CLERK
(to Melanie)
It's Alice.
MELANIE
Are you sure?
CLERK
Well, I ain't positive, if that's
what you mean.
MELANIE
I need her exact name, you see.
CLERK
That case, I tell you what you do.
You go straight through town 'til
you see a little hotel on your left
there. Not the motel, that's the
other end of town. This is the hotel.
Now you take a right turn there, you
got that?
MELANIE
Yes?
CLERK
Near the top of the hill, you'll see
the school and right behind it, the
church. You head for the school.
Now just past the school, you'll see
a little house with a red mail box.
That's where Annie Hayworth lives,
she's the school teacher. You ask
her about the little Brenner girl.
MELANIE
Thank you.
CLERK
Yep.
(pause)
Could save yourself a lot of trouble.
Her name's Alice for sure.
MELANIE
Can I have the boat in about twenty
minutes?
The Clerk nods.
MELANIE
How much for the phone calls?
CLERK
(brushing this aside)
It's nothing.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
grinning, as she makes for the door and EXITS.
EXT. GENERAL STORE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house.
CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX
with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal:
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.
The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the
front door. There are white curtains in every window of the
house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway
advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
waiting. She RINGS the bell again:
ANNIE'S VOICE
(shouting)
Yes? Who is it?
MELANIE
Me!
ANNIE'S VOICE
Who's me?
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of
the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for
flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the
house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-
two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face. Her
hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the
garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-
stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling
of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.
MELANIE
Miss Hayworth?
ANNIE
Yes?
MELANIE
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to
bother you, but...
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and
groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay. She
studies her openly.
ANNIE
Yes?
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
MELANIE
The man at the post office sent me.
He said you'd know the name of the
little Brenner girl.
ANNIE
Cathy?
MELANIE
The one who lives in the white house
across the bay?
ANNIE
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
MELANIE
(smiling)
They seemed sure it was either Alice
or Lois.
ANNIE
Which is why the mail in this town
never gets delivered to the right
place.
(She takes out package
of cigarettes, offers
one to Melanie)
Did you want to see Cathy about
something?
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
taking cigarette, hesitating.
MELANIE
Well... not exactly.
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
studying her, thinking she understands.
ANNIE
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
MELANIE
No, not really.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She
puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.
ANNIE
I've been wanting a cigarette for
the past twenty minutes, but I
couldn't convince myself to stop.
This 'tilling of the soil' can get a
little compulsive, you know.
MELANIE
It's a lovely garden.
ANNIE
Thank you. It gives me something to
do with my spare time.
(pause)
There's a lot of spare time in Bodega
Bay.
(another pause)
Did you plan on staying long?
MELANIE
No. Just a few hours.
ANNIE
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
MELANIE
Well... something like that.
(pause)
I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so
mysterious.
ANNIE
Actually, it's none of my business.
There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it
is none of Annie's business.
ANNIE
(putting out cigarette)
I'd better get on my way. Thank you
very much.
ANNIE
Not at all.
They begin walking toward the car.
ANNIE
(still curious)
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
MELANIE
Yes.
ANNIE
It's a nice drive.
(pause)
Is that where you met Mitch?
MELANIE
(hesitating, then)
Yes.
ANNIE
I guess that's where everyone meets
him.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost
on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her
face.
MELANIE
Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss
Hayworth.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
as Annie leans over the seat.
ANNIE
Do I?
(she shakes her head,
smiles wistfully)
No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
(pause)
Or maybe a closed one.
(she smiles again,
sees the lovebirds)
Pretty. What are they?
MELANIE
Lovebirds.
Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship
with Mitch:
ANNIE
Mmm.
(pause)
Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
MELANIE
Thank you.
She nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away.
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
watching the car, a look of sad resignation on her face.
DISSOLVE
MED. SHOT - MELANIE

HIGH SHOT
She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the
bird cage in her hand. Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman.
She asks for her boat. The fisherman nods. He leads her to
the dock and the waiting boat. She gets into the outboard
motorboat, the fisherman helping her. He hands down the
lovebirds in their cage.

course for the house on the other side.
VERY LONG SHOT (MATTE)
Another spectacular SHOT of the small boat.
FULL SHOT - THE BOAT
coming head-on toward CAMERA, Melanie at the tiller. She
cuts the motor. The motor drifts to a stop. The bay is silent
except for the cry of the gulls.
LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a
little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and
a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the
engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the
truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch
Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this
distance -- and he comes over to the truck.
The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and
heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust
behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking
after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up
toward the barn in the distance.
CLOSE SHOT

The barn door closed, still no sign of Mitch.

The CAMERA IS MOVING WITH her as she looks toward Mitch.
LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

her head tilted back, a smile on her face.
FULL SHOT - GULL

GULL - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
The gull soars away from LOWER RIGHTHAND corner of frame to
UPPER LEFT.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
reacting to the sudden attack and looking after receding
gull. Blood is starting down her temple from her hair.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
as the boat comes closer. The boat drifts in toward a second
boat tied up at the dock. Mitch crosses the docked boat,
leaps into Melanie's boat.
MED. SHOT - MITCH AND MELANIE
in the boat.
MITCH
That was the damndest thing I ever
saw.
MELANIE
What made it...
MITCH
It deliberately came down at you --
you're bleeding...
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
a thin line of blood trickling from the cut on top of her
head, down onto her forehead and cheek. She seems dazed.
She shakes her head in answer to him, then touches the top
of her head, looks at her bloody fingers, and then nods
weakly.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
concerned.
MITCH
Come on, let's take care of that.
FULL SHOT - THE DOCK
as they climb onto it. A fisherman standing by looks at
Melanie curiously.
FISHERMAN
What happened, Mitch?
MITCH
(over his shoulder)
A gull hit her.
FISHERMAN
A what?
The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they walk across the parking area
behind the Tides, and to the closest office. Mitch tries the
door knob. The door is locked.
INSERT - SIGN ON DOOR OUT TO LUNCH TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND
MITCH
as he tries door of next office. It, too, is locked.
MITCH
Come on, we'd better go up to the
restaurant.
They walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing
gas station across the road, the collection of stores
opposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door
for her, and they ENTER.
INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT
This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of
a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar,
and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two
ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are
sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall
of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the
bay and the parking area below. A television set over the
bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western
movie should be HEARD muted throughout following. DEKE
CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates
his attention between serving his customers and watching the
Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.
MED. SHOT - THE BAR
Mitch and Melanie coming over to it.
MITCH
Deke, have you got a first aid kit
back there?
DEKE
(instantly alarmed)
What happened?
MITCH
Young woman cut herself.
DEKE
Shall I call the doctor?
MITCH
(accepting the first
aid kit)
I don't think it's that serious.
You want to sit up here?
Melanie climbs onto the stool.
DEKE
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
MITCH
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a
boat.
He is rummaging around in the kit.
DEKE
I had a man trip and fall in the
parking lot once, sued me before I
could bat an eyelash.
MITCH
I don't think Miss Daniels is going
to sue anybody.
DEKE
(doubtfully)
Well, you're the lawyer.
(goes to other end of
bar)
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide.
MELANIE
What's that?
MITCH
Just some peroxide. I want to clean
out the cut.
He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the
cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:
MELANIE
So you're a lawyer.
MITCH
That's right. What are you doing in
Bodega Bay?
MELANIE
Do you practice here?
MITCH
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
MELANIE
What kind of law?
MITCH
Criminal.
MELANIE
Is that why you'd like to see everyone
behind bars?
MITCH
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
MELANIE
Only violators and practical jokers.
MELANIE
That's right.
As he swabs cut.
MELANIE
Ouch!
MITCH
I'm sorry.
(pause)
What are you doing up here?
MELANIE
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
MITCH
You came all the way up here to bring
me those birds?
MELANIE
To bring your sister those birds.
You said it was her birthday.
Besides, I was coming up anyway.
MITCH
What for?
MELANIE
To see a friend of mine.
(she winces)
Will you please be careful?
MITCH
I'm sorry.
(pause)
Who's your friend?
MELANIE
Why...
(pause, stymied)
MITCH
Yes?
MELANIE
(blurting the only
name she knows)
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
MITCH
Well, well, small world. Annie
Hayworth.
MELANIE
(realizing this was a
mistake)
Yes.
MITCH
How do you know Annie?
MELANIE
(the lie getting deeper)
We... we went to school together.
College.
MITCH
Did you! Imagine that! How long will
you be staying?
MELANIE
Just a few... just a day or two...
the weekend.
MITCH
I think we'll have to shave the hair.
Deke, have you got a razor?
MELANIE
(pulling away)
Oh, no you don't!
MITCH
It's still bleeding a little. Here,
let me put this on.
He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:
MITCH
Bend your head down. This little
Band-Aid won't show.
He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a
mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at
it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:
MITCH
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
MELANIE
Yes.
MITCH
I don't believe you.
(grins)
I think you came up to see me.
MELANIE
Why would I want to see you, of all
people?
MITCH
(shrugging)
I don't know. But it seems to me you
must have gone to a lot of trouble
to find out who I was, and where I
lived and...
MELANIE
It was no trouble at all. I simply
called my father's paper. Besides, I
was coming up here anyway, I already
told you...
MITCH
(grinning)
You like me, huh?
MELANIE
I loathe you. You have no manners.
And you're arrogant and conceited
and... I wrote you a letter about
it, in fact, but I tore it up.
MITCH
What did it say?
MELANIE
None of your business.
(pause)
Am I still bleeding?
She lowers her head.
MITCH
Can't see a thing.
MELANIE
I can't say I like your seagulls
much, either. I come all the way up
here to...
MITCH
But you were coming up anyway,
remember?
MELANIE
I was! And all I get for my pains is
a... a... a hole in the head!
MITCH
(grinning)
Right next to the one you already
had.
MELANIE
(angrily)
Look, Mr. Brenner...
LYDIA (O.S.)
Mitch?
They turn toward the door.
MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER
closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a
woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse,
cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking
about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city
dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.
LYDIA
(puzzled)
I thought I saw your car. What are
you doing in town?
MITCH
(rising to greet her)
I had to acknowledge a delivery.
(grins)
Mother, I'd like you to meet...
LYDIA
A what?
MITCH
(continuing)
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure,
but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the
introduction.
LYDIA
How do you do, Miss Daniels?
(to Mitch)
Acknowledge a what?
BACK TO SCENE
MITCH
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels
brought some birds from San Francisco.
Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San
Francisco chippies.
LYDIA
Oh. I see.
MITCH
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the
way, where is she?
LYDIA
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
MITCH
Miss Daniels is staying for the
weekend. In fact, I've already invited
her to dinner tonight.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
MITCH
After all, you did go to the trouble
of bringing up those birds.
MELANIE (O.S.)
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
BACK TO SCENE
LYDIA
You did say birds?
MITCH
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
LYDIA
(understanding
completely now)
Lovebirds, I see.
MITCH
...get away without thanking you in
some small way. After all, you haven't
even met Cathy and you are staying
for the weekend...
MELANIE
Yes, but...
MITCH
You are, aren't you?
MELANIE
Certainly, but...
MITCH
Then it's settled. What time is
dinner, Mother?
LYDIA
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
MITCH
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.
Where are you staying?
MELANIE
With... with Annie, of course.
MITCH
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter
to seven, will that be all right?
MELANIE
Annie... Annie may have made other
plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I
can find my own way.
MITCH
You're sure now? You won't hire a
boat or anything?
MELANIE
I'm sure.
MITCH
Seven o'clock then.
MELANIE
Maybe.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
grinning.
MITCH
We'll be waiting. How's your head
now?
MED. SHOT - THE GROUP
Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly.
MELANIE
(with an overwarm
smile)
It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull
hit me, that's all.
Lydia stares at her doubtfully.
DISSOLVE
EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT
Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her
hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still
in the window. The door suddenly opens.
ANNIE
(surprised)
Oh, hi!
(pause)
Did you find her all right?
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
MELANIE
Yes, I did.
There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at
Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.
MELANIE
I was wondering...
ANNIE
Yes?
MELANIE
That sign.
(pause)
Do you think I could have the room
for a single night?
ANNIE
Well, I'd really hope to rent it
for...
MELANIE
I would appreciate it. I've tried
everywhere in town, and they're all
full.
ANNIE
(after a pause)
Sure. You can have it.
(smiles)
Where's your bag? In the car?
Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then
smiles.
ANNIE
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for
it.
MELANIE
(smiling)
I just picked up some things for the
night at the general store. You see,
I hadn't planned on spending much
time here.
ANNIE
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected
crop up?
There is a moment where both women look at each other...
When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she
is again telling Annie to mind her own business.
MELANIE
Yes.
(pause)
May I use your phone? I'd like to
call home.
There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's
attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.
ANNIE
Why don't you come in then? I was
just about to mix a martini.
She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both
hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.
LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS
flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.
TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE
ANNIE
(shaking her head)
Don't they ever stop migrating?
But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously
serious expression.
DISSOLVE
LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's
car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained
with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the
silence.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
as it pulls into the Brenner yard.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine
her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand.
She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.
She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no
answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In
the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from
behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting.
MELANIE
(calling)
Hi!
FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA
in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.
CATHY
(excitedly)
Hi!
(she breaks into a
trot toward Melanie)
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-
old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt
and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates
for just a moment.
CATHY
Miss Daniels?
MELANIE
Yes?
And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking
her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.
CATHY
They're beautiful! They're just what
I wanted! Is there a man and a woman?
I can't tell which is which.
MELANIE
Well, I suppose...
FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM
MITCH
(coming up)
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm
glad you came. Are you hungry?
MELANIE
Famished.
MITCH
Dinner's just about ready.
(explaining)
We were out back looking at the
chickens. Something seems to be wrong
with them.
LYDIA
(going toward house)
There's nothing wrong with those
chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call
Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
MITCH
(as they follow into
house)
I don't know what good that'll do.
(aside to Melanie)
Chickens won't eat.
FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE
as they ENTER, CAMERA FOLLOWING them throughout into dining
room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along.
LYDIA
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
MITCH
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer
beware.
LYDIA
Whose side are you on?
MITCH
I'm simply quoting the law.
LYDIA
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can
start serving the soup.
She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone
RINGS.
LYDIA
This won't take a minute, Miss Dan...
(into phone)
Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner.
I didn't interrupt your dinner, did
I?
(pause)
Fred, that feed you sold me is no
good.
(pause)
The chicken feed. The three bags I
brought.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
holding the telephone.
LYDIA
Well, it's just no good. The chickens
won't eat it.
(pause)
They're always hungry, Fred. I opened
one of the sacks when I got home,
and I poured it out for them, and
they wouldn't touch it. Now you know
chickens as well as I do, and when
they won't eat, there's just something
wrong with what they're being fed,
that's all.
(pause)
No, they're not fussy chickens.
(pause)
Who? What's he got to do with it?
(pause)
Fred, I don't care how much feed you
sold him. My chickens...
(pause)
He did? Dan Fawcett?
(pause)
This afternoon?
(pause)
Well, that only proves what I'm
saying. The feed you sold us is...
(pause)
Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-
huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see
him. You don't think there's something
going around, do you?
(pause)
No, never.
(pause)
No, Fred, they don't seem sick at
all. They just won't eat.
(pause)
Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get
over to Dan's farm. Maybe he'll...
mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred,
thanks.
(she hangs up, puzzled)
FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM
as Lydia comes to the table. Mitch and Melanie are sitting
opposite each other in the center chairs. Cathy is serving
the last bowl of soup.
LYDIA
(as she sits)
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a
little while ago. His chickens won't
eat, either.
CATHY
It's what you said, Mom. Mr.
Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
LYDIA
(slowly)
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a
different brand.
(extremely worried)
You don't think they're getting sick,
do you, Mitch?
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

DISSOLVE
FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have
been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are
carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g.
Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is
playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from
the ashtray now and again to take a puff.
CATHY
I still don't understand how you
knew I wanted lovebirds.
MELANIE
Your brother told me.
LYDIA
(as she goes into
kitchen)
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco,
is that right?
MELANIE
No, not exactly.
CATHY
Mitch knows lots of people in San
Francisco. Of course, they're mostly
hoods.
LYDIA
(from the kitchen)
Cathy!
CATHY
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit
it.
(to Melanie)
He spends half his day in the
detention cells at the Hall of
Justice.
LYDIA
(coming from kitchen)
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is
entitled to a fair trial. Your
brother's practice...
CATHY
Mom, please, I know all the democracy
jazz. They're still hoods.
(to Melanie)
He's got a client now who shot his
wife in the head six times. Six times,
can you imagine it?
(she starts for living
room)
I mean, even twice would be overdoing
it, don't you think?
MELANIE
(to Mitch as he carries
load of dishes out)
Why did he shoot her?
MITCH
He was watching a ball game on
television.
MELANIE
What?
MITCH
His wife changed the channel.
He GOES INTO kitchen.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY
Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her
cigarette.
CATHY
Is smoking fun?
MELANIE
Oh, I suppose so.
CATHY
Could I have a puff?
MELANIE
I don't think your mother would like
that.
CATHY (O.S.)
Just a little one.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY
They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen.
Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes
a small puff.
CATHY
(delighted)
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?
(determined)
When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like
a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow,
you know.
MELANIE
I know.
CATHY
Are you coming to my party?
MELANIE
I don't think so.
(seeing the child's
face)
I have to get back to San Francisco.
CATHY
Don't you like us?
MELANIE
(touching her hair)
Darling, of course I do!
CATHY
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
MELANIE
I don't know yet.
CATHY
Mitch likes it very much. He comes
up every weekend, you know, even
though he has his own apartment in
the city. He says San Francisco is
just an ant hill at the foot of a
bridge.
MELANIE
(smiling)
I guess it does get a little hectic
at times.
CATHY
If you do decide to come, don't say
I told you about it. It's supposed
to be a surprise party.
Melanie laughs.
CATHY
You see, they've got this whole
complicated thing figured out where
I'm going over to Michele's for the
afternoon, and Michele's mother is
going to say she has a headache and
would I mind very much if she took
me home. Then, when we get back here,
all of the kids'll jump out!
(pause)
Won't you come? Won't you please
come?
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen.
MELANIE
I don't think so, Cathy.
INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.
LYDIA
She's a charming girl, isn't she,
Mitch?
MITCH
Yes, very.
LYDIA
And certainly pretty.
MITCH
Yes.
LYDIA
How long have you known her?
MITCH
I told you. We met yesterday.
LYDIA
In a bird shop.
MITCH
Yes.
LYDIA
She was selling birds.
MITCH
No. I only led her into believing I
believed she was... Mother, it's
really very complicated.
LYDIA
But she did buy the lovebirds and
then brought them all the way...
MITCH
Mother, where did you go to law
school?
LYDIA
(laughing)
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just
naturally curious about a girl like
that.
(pause)
She's very rich, isn't she?
MITCH
I suppose so. Her father owns a big
newspaper in San Francisco.
LYDIA
You'd think he could manage to keep
her name out of print. She's always
mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
MITCH
I know, Mother.
LYDIA
She is the one who jumped into that
fountain in Rome last summer, isn't
she?
MITCH
Yes, Mother.
LYDIA
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.
(pause)
I know it was supposed to be very
warm there, Mitch, but... well...
actually... well, the newspaper said
she was naked.
MITCH
I know, Mother.
LYDIA
It's none of my business, of course,
but when you bring a girl like that
to...
MITCH
Mother?
LYDIA
(looking up)
Yes?
MITCH
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels
by myself.
LYDIA
Well...

So long as you know what you want,

MELANIE
Oh, yes.
MELANIE
Will I be seeing you again?
MELANIE
San Francisco's a long way from here.
MITCH
I'm in San Francisco five days a
week. With a lot of time on my hands.
I'd like to see you.
(he grins)
Maybe we could go swimming or
something. Mother tells me you like
to swim.
MELANIE
How does Mother know what I like to
do?
MITCH
I guess she and I read the same gossip
columns.
MELANIE
Oh. That. Rome.
MITCH
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get
along very...
MELANIE
In case you're interested, I was
pushed into that fountain.
MELANIE
Without any clothes on?
MELANIE
With all my clothes on! The newspaper
that ran the story happens to be a
rival of my father's paper. Anything
they said...
MITCH
You were just a poor, innocent victim
of circumstance, huh?
MELANIE
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but
the truth of that particular...
MITCH
The truth is you were running around
with a pretty wild crowd...
MELANIE
Yes, but...
MITCH
...who didn't much care for propriety
or convention or...
MELANIE
Yes.
MITCH
...the opinions of others, and you
went right along with them, isn't
that the truth?
MELANIE
Yes, that's the truth. But I was
pushed into that fountain, and that's
the truth, too.
MITCH
Sure. Do you really know Annie
Hayworth?
MELANIE
No.
(pause)
At least, I didn't until I came up
here.
MITCH
So you didn't go to school together.
MELANIE
No.
MITCH
And you didn't come up here to see
her.
MELANIE
No.
MITCH
You were lying.
MELANIE
Yes, I was lying.
MITCH
Did you really write a letter to me?
Or was that a lie, too?
MELANIE
I wrote the letter.
MITCH
What did it say?
MELANIE
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think
you need those lovebirds, after all.
They may help your personality."
That's what it said.
MITCH
But you tore it up.
MELANIE
Yes.
MITCH
Why?
MELANIE
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
MITCH
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
MELANIE
I told you what happened in Rome!
MITCH
Do you expect me to believe...?
MELANIE
I don't give a damn what you believe!
Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door

MELANIE (O.S.)
Yes.
Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:
ANNIE
Hi.
(seeing her face)
Is something wrong? Is that cut
beginning to bother you?
MELANIE
(touching her head)
No, it's not the cut that's bothering
me.
ANNIE
(concerned)
Would you like some brandy?
MELANIE
If you have some, I'd...
ANNIE
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.
Do you want a sweater or something?
A quilt?
As Annie gets the brandy:
MELANIE
No, thank you.
(pause)
Won't you call me Melanie?
ANNIE
All right.
(she smiles)
MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her.
She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact,
by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her
the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.
MELANIE
Thank you.
ANNIE
(sitting opposite her)
It gets a little chilly here at night
sometimes. Especially if you're over
near the bay.
Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.
ANNIE
Well, how'd your evening go?
Melanie shrugs.
ANNIE
Did you meet Lydia?
Melanie nods.
ANNIE
Or would you rather I changed the
subject?
MELANIE
(with a tired smile)
I think so.
ANNIE
(nodding)
How do you like our little hamlet?
MELANIE
I despise it.
ANNIE
(laughing)
Well, I don't suppose it offers much
to the casual visitor. Unless you're
thrilled by a collection of shacks
on a hillside. It takes a while to
get used to.
MELANIE
Where are you from originally, Annie?
ANNIE
San Francisco.
MELANIE
How'd you happen to come here?
ANNIE
Oh, someone invited me up for the
weekend a long time ago.
There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.
ANNIE
Look, I see no reason for being coy
about this. It was Mitch Brenner.
Melanie nods.
ANNIE
I guess you knew that, anyway.
MELANIE
I suspected as much.
ANNIE
You needn't worry. It's over and
done with. A long time ago.
MELANIE
Annie -- there's nothing between
Mitch and me.
ANNIE
Isn't there?
(she shrugs)
Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's
never anything between Mitch and any
girl.
MELANIE
What do you mean?
ANNIE
I think I'll have some of that, too.
(she pours brandy,
drinks, sighs)
I was seeing quite a lot of him in
San Francisco, you know.
(she smiles weakly)
And then, one weekend, he asked me
up to meet Lydia.
MELANIE
When was this?
ANNIE
Four years ago. Of course, that was
shortly after his father died. Things
may be different now.
MELANIE
Different?
ANNIE
With Lydia.
(pause)
Did she seem a trifle distant?
MELANIE
(smiling)
A trifle.
ANNIE
Then maybe it isn't different at
all. You know, her attitude nearly
drove me crazy. I simply couldn't
understand it.
ANNIE
When I got back to San Francisco I
spent days trying to figure out just
what I'd done to displease her.
MELANIE
And what had you done?
ANNIE
Nothing! I simply existed. So what
was the answer? A jealous woman,
right? A clinging possessive mother.
(she shakes her head)
Wrong. With all due respect to
Oedipus, I don't think that was the
case at all.
MELANIE
Then what was it?
ANNIE
Lydia liked me, you see. That was
the strange part of it. In fact, now
that I'm no longer a threat, we're
very good friends.
MELANIE
Then why did she object to you?
ANNIE
Because she was afraid.
MELANIE
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
ANNIE
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
MELANIE
I don't understand.
ANNIE
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch
the only thing Lydia can give him --
love.
MELANIE
Annie, that adds up to a jealous,
possessive woman.
ANNIE
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid
of losing her son, you see. She's
only afraid of being abandoned.
MELANIE
Someone ought to tell her she'd be
gaining a daughter.
ANNIE
She already has a daughter.
MELANIE
What about Mitch? Didn't he have
anything to say about this?
ANNIE
(apologetically)
I can understand his position. He
went through a lot with Lydia after
his father died. He didn't want to
risk going through it all over again.
MELANIE
I see.
ANNIE
So it ended. Not immediately, of
course. I went back to San Francisco,
and I still saw Mitch every now and
then... but we both knew it was
finished.
MELANIE
Then what are you doing here in Bodega
Bay?
ANNIE
You get straight to the point, don't
you?
MELANIE
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
ANNIE
No, that's all right, I don't mind.
I came up here for two reasons. To
begin with, I was bored with my job
in San Francisco. I was teaching at
a private school there... well, you
know, you probably went to one
yourself.
MELANIE
I did.
ANNIE
Then you know. Little girls in brown
beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life.
I'll go into that classroom on Monday
morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
five upturned little faces, and each
of them will be saying, 'Yes, please
give me what you have.'
(pause)
And I'll give them what I have. I
haven't got very much, but I'll give
them every ounce of it. To me, that's
very important. It makes me want to
stay alive for a long long time.
(she sighs)
That's the first reason.
MELANIE
And the second?
ANNIE
(simply)
I wanted to be near Mitch.
(pause)
It was over, and I knew it, but I
wanted to be near him, anyway.
(she smiles)
You see, I still like him a hell of
a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't
want to lose his friendship... ever.
There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE
shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer
it.
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
at the phone.
ANNIE
Hello? Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't
asleep. What is it?
(pause)
Yes, just a little while ago. Sure,
hold on.
(she turns to Melanie)
It's Mitch. For you.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie
hesitating.
ANNIE
He's waiting.
Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie
to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her
throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie
talks to Mitch in the background.
Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a
wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally
and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.
MELANIE
(at phone; coolly)
Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine,
thank you. No, no trouble at all. I
simply followed the road. It's a
very bright night.
(pause)
What? Oh. Well, there's no need to
apologize. I can understand...
(pause; she listens)
Well...
(she listens again)
That's very kind of you. No, I'm not
angry.
(she listens)
I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get
back to San Francisco.
(pause)
No, I wouldn't want to disappoint
Cathy, but...
(pause)
I see.
(she is warming)
I see. Well, if you really...
(pause)
All right. Yes, I'll be there.
(pause)
Good night, Mitch.
She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.
MELANIE
He wants me to go to Cathy's party
tomorrow afternoon.
(pause)
I said I would.
ANNIE
I'll be going, too, to help out. It
should be fun, Melanie.
MELANIE
It seems so pointless.
(she sighs)
I think I'll go to sleep. This has
been a busy day.
(picking up her paper
bag)
My luggage.
She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.
ANNIE
Pretty. Did you get that at
Brinkmeyer's?
Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent
for a moment, pensive. Then:
MELANIE
Do you think I should go?
ANNIE
That's up to you.
MELANIE
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
ANNIE
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
MELANIE
(firmly)
Yes.
ANNIE
Then go.
The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.
MELANIE
Thank you, Annie.
Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door,
startling them both.
ANNIE
(rising)
Who can that be at this hour?
(she walks to door)
Who is it?
(no answer)
Is someone there?
Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks
the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.
There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.
ANNIE
(to the emptiness
outside)
Is anyone there?
MELANIE
(pointing to the ground)
Look.
CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
ANNIE
(sympathetically)
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably
lost his way in the dark.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.
And then, slowly:
MELANIE
But... it isn't dark, Annie. There's
a full moon.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and
consternation:
FADE OUT
FADE IN
HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with
balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn.
The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are
clustered around a long folding table upon which are
sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either
helping the children to more or telling them they are having
too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and
LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party,
are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and
away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin
bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the
entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background.
The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more,
the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the
CAMERA out to the left.
CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES
Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and
stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one
of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one
of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.
MELANIE
I really shouldn't have any more.
I'm a little tipsy already.
MITCH
I'm trying to get you to stay for
dinner. We're going to have a lot of
roast left over.
MELANIE
I couldn't possibly. I have to get
back.
MITCH
(with a shrug)
Cheers.
MELANIE
Cheers.
They drink.
MELANIE
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
MITCH
Why do you have to rush off? What's
so important in San Francisco?
MELANIE
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow
morning, for one thing.
MITCH
(surprised)
You have a job?
MELANIE
(sipping at the martini)
I have several jobs.
MITCH
What do you do?
MELANIE
I do different things on different
days.
MITCH
Like what?
MELANIE
(hesitating)
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work
for the Travelers' Aid. At the
airport.
MITCH
Helping travelers.
MELANIE
Yes.
She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really
considered before what she does with her time, and now that
she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and
unimportant.
MELANIE
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in
General Semantics at Berkeley. That's
not a job, of course. I just take it
because...
MITCH
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
MELANIE
On Thursdays I have my meeting and
lunch.
(pause)
I'm chairman of a group that's sending
a little Korean boy through school.
We plan how to raise funds and...
things like that.
(she shrugs)
MITCH
And Fridays? What do you do then?
MELANIE
Nothing.
(she smiles)
I go to bird shops on Fridays.
MITCH
I'm glad you do.
MELANIE
Do you know what I was doing in that
shop?
MITCH
What?
MELANIE
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa.
She's seventy years old, and veddy
prim and strait-laced.
(she does an imitation)
She's coming back from Europe at the
end of the month, and I'm going to
give her a myna bird that'll talk to
her.
MITCH
What'll it say?
MELANIE
(facetiously)
You'll think me very bold, sir.
MITCH
No, tell me.
She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out
LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into
Melanie's face.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
serious, introspective.
MELANIE
That's silly, isn't it? Teaching a
bird to shock my aunt. That's just
silly and childish.
(slight pause)
Maybe I ought to go join the other
children.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where
the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch
stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse
of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children
are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold
from Michele to Cathy.
CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH
The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We
see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by
way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they
reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of
the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS
OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the
children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from
Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back. During
this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes
of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is
watching Mitch and Melanie.
MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.
MED. SHOT - ANNIE
CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this
moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday
cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also
catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat
as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple.
During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy
off.
ANNIE
All right then, here we go.
(she spins her)
Once!
(she spins her again)
Twice!
(she spins her again)
Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!
She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She
turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on
her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as
though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.
Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:
LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
Look! Look!
Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as
she looks up.
LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.
A gull is swooping down.
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously
reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly
swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.
CATHY
No touching allowed!
She almost falls.
FULL SHOT - THE GULL
seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then
returns.
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.
MED. SHOT - ANNIE
with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as
she ducks with two gulls swooping by.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
hurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round
to the front of it.
FULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
Annie rising from the ground. Cathy and the other children
are running in the background.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
reacting to two more gulls diving.
FULL SHOT - TWO GULLS - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
diving toward the children.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
She starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT.
MED. SHOT - LYDIA REACHES CATHY
She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks.
TWO SHOT - TWO MOTHERS
as a gull swoops between them.
FULL SHOT - MITCH
coming out of the house with a broom.
TWO GULLS
swooping down at the children's heads.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
swinging at gull and missing.
LONG SHOT - LITTLE BOY
running toward bank. Gull swooping after him.
CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY
falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into
him.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
running to the injured boy, who is lying against the bank.
THREE SHOT - MELANIE, MITCH AND LITTLE BOY
They look up.
LONG SHOT - THE GULLS
against the sky, flying away in formation.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no
longer there. A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to
Melanie.
MITCH
Are you all right?
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MELANIE
Yes.
ANNIE
(coming over)
That's the darnest thing thing I've
ever seen in my life.
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
LYDIA
Are they gone?
MITCH
They're gone, Mother.
FULL SHOT - THE LAWN
as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the
cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck
very close by without having injured anyone. All that
adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.
LYDIA
Well... well, is everyone all right?
MITCH
(with a small boy)
I think he got a little scratch,
Mother.
GIRL #3
Did you see them? They were hawks!
GIRL #4
They were bigger than hawks!
ANNIE
Children, they were only seagulls.
And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her,
and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.
TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE
as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent
meaningful glance.
BACK TO SCENE
CATHY
They must have been after the food,
Mother.
They all turn toward the table.
CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE,
UNDISTURBED CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
eyes narrowed.
MITCH
They didn't touch anything.
BACK TO SCENE
ANNIE
(trying to restore
order)
Well, they're gone now, so... so
let's...
(pause)
Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't
you, Cathy?
GIRL #2
Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
as Annie and the children begin the game behind them.
MITCH
You look a little shaken.
MELANIE
I... I am.
(pause)
Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual,
is it? The gull yesterday when I was
in the boat, and the one last night
at Annie's, and now...
MITCH
Last night? What do you mean?
MELANIE
A gull smashed into Annie's front
door.
(pause)
Mitch... what's happening?
MITCH
(concerned)
I don't know, Melanie.
(pause)
Look, do you have to go back to
Annie's?
MELANIE
No, I have my things in the car.
MITCH
(gently)
Then stay and have something to eat
before you start back. I'd feel a
lot better.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
She nods, and then looks up at the sky. Suddenly she shudders.
DISSOLVE
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HANDS - DINING ROOM INT. IN BACKGROUND
He is slicing the leftover roast beef.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to
call into living room. The lovebirds in their cage are making
a terrible racket.
MITCH
Do you want some mustard with this?
MELANIE (O.S.)
No, thank you.
CATHY
(coming from kitchen)
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
MITCH
She said something about having to
get home to take a call from her
mother back East.
CATHY
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
MITCH
Take it into the living room, would
you, hon?
CATHY
(seeing the birds)
What's the matter with them?
Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some
French bread.
LYDIA
What's the matter with all the birds?
She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still
tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment,
and then signs heavily.
LYDIA
Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm
sure Miss Daniels wants to get on
her way.
As she moves into the living room.
CATHY
I think you ought to stay the night,
Melanie.
INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
a sharp look at her daughter.
MED. SHOT - CATHY
pouring coffee into the cups set on coffee table.
CATHY
We've got an extra room upstairs and
everything.
MITCH
(coming in with two
plates)
That road can be a bad one at night,
Melanie.
(he picks up coffee
cup, hands it to
Melanie)
They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet
style.
MELANIE
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll
come onto the freeway much earlier.
LYDIA
(picking up a cup)
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted,
isn't it, Mitch?
MITCH
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that
traffic going back to San Francisco.
CATHY
Did you put the cover on that cage,
Mom?
LYDIA
Yes, I did.
CATHY
Just listen to them!
MITCH
(to Melanie)
Some cream?
MELANIE
I'll get it.
She reaches over for the cream pitcher. Her eye is caught by
something in the fireplace.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
looking curiously.
CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE
a single swift is sitting on the hearth.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

Mitch!

hundreds of birds pouring into the room.

shrieking in terror, dropping her coffee cup.

Cathy, get some matches!
MED. SHOT - CATHY
running for the kitchen. Birds swooping after her.

swinging the fireplace broom.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
rushing to the fireplace. He is almost knocked over by birds
coming out of the opening. He stuffs paper under the logs
already in place there.

She lets out a horrified scream. There are birds fluttering
in her hair, caught there.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
swinging the broom, covered with birds.
MED. SHOT - A PICTURE ON THE WALL

bird flutters against it.
MED. SHOT - CATHY
running into the room, covering her face with bent arm,
rushing to Mitch with the box of matches.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
taking the matches. He lights one. A bird hits his arm. He
drops the match. He lights another one.
CLOSE SHOT - THE MATCH
falling onto the paper in the fireplace. It flickers for a
moment, then catches. Birds are still pouring out, past the
paper beginning to catch.
CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE
as a bird crashes through it.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
rushing to Lydia, swinging the cloth at her head. She is
hysterics now, BABBLING. The SHRIEK of the birds is a wild
cacophony.
CLOSE SHOT - THE FIRE

MED. SHOT - A BIRD
swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
less birds in the air now, the single flaming bird flying

MELANIE

askew, the floor covered with birds and broken glass. In a
corner of the room, Lydia crouches with her hands covering
her face, sobbing. The burnt curtain is still smoldering.
Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom
wearily. The attack is over.
DISSOLVE
INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND
reaching down to pick up a dead bird.
MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY
a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out
speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the
palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.
MALONE
That's a chimney swift, all right.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
MITCH
We know what it is, Al.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.
MALONE
Well, these birds live in chimneys,
you know.
MITCH
Not by the thousands.
MALONE
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.
(pause)
Did you have a light burning or
something.
MITCH
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
MALONE
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted
by light, you know.
(pause)
Sure is a peculiar thing.
MITCH
What are we going to do about it,
Al?
MALONE
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do
about what?
MITCH
Well...
(he feels a little
foolish)
Well... these birds attacked us.
CLOSE SHOT - MALONE
slight disbelief on his face.
MALONE
What's more likely, they got in the
room and was just panicked, that's
all.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
MITCH
(still a little
hesitant)
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll
panic in an enclosed room. But, they
didn't just get in. They came in!
Right down that chimney.
TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
MALONE
(trying to make sense
of this)
My wife found a bird in the back
seat of her car once.
MALONE
(shrugs)
Didn't know how he got in there.
Had a broken leg, turned out. Just
fluttering all around there.
(he shrugs again)
MITCH
These birds were...
MALONE
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is
these things happen sometimes, you
know? Ain't much we can do about it.
(he shrugs)
LYDIA
Tell him about the party.
MITCH
That's right. We had a party here
this afternoon for Cathy. Her
birthday.
MALONE
Oh, yeah, yeah.
(he grins)
How old is she now?
MITCH
Eleven. In the middle of the party,
some gulls came down at the children.
And Miss Daniels was attacked by a
gull just yesterday after...
CLOSE SHOT - MALONE
considering this.
MALONE
Yeah.
(thinking)
Were the kids bothering them or
something? 'Cause sometimes they'll
do that, you know. If you make any
kind of disturbance near them, they'll
just come after you. I seen that
plenty of times myself.
TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA
LYDIA
The children were playing a game,
Al. Those gulls attacked without...
MALONE
Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty
strong word, don't you think? I mean,
birds just don't go around attacking
people without no reason, you know
what I mean? The kids just probably
scared them, that's all.
LYDIA
These birds attacked!
MALONE
(nodding)
Well, what would you like me to do,
Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on
any suspicious birds in the area?
(he smiles)
Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't
it?
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
MITCH
Does this room look silly?
TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
MALONE
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll
admit that.
(pause)
Maybe you oughta put some screening
on top of your chimney
(pause)
Seems a little pointless, though.
Freak accident like this wouldn't
happen again in a million years.
(pause)
You want some help cleaning up?
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
exasperated.
MITCH
I can handle it myself.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
giving a small moan.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
MELANIE
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
MITCH
Are you staying?
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
MELANIE
I think I should, don't you?
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
observing, making no comment.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
putting her arm around Cathy's shoulders.
MELANIE
I'll get my things from the car. Do
you want to walk with me, Cathy?
TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
as Cathy and Melanie go out.
MALONE
Well, if there's anything else I can
do, Mitch...
MITCH
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
MALONE
Goodnight, Lydia.
No answer.
MALONE
Sure is peculiar, I got to say that
for it.
He exits.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
It is silent. Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still
as a stone in her chair. The door closes gently on a note of
utter helplessness.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather
unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store. Her
hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a
lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is
busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS
VOICES.
LYDIA'S VOICE
Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to
drop Cathy off now.
MITCH'S VOICE
Okay.
LYDIA'S VOICE
I'll probably drive over to the
Fawcett farm. Do you need anything
in town?
MITCH'S VOICE
No.
Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window
and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck
starting.
FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck
and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the
road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA
FOLLOWING. She opens the door.
MELANIE
Mitch?
There is no answer.
MELANIE
Mitch?
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops
at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on
her face.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS
She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds
TWEET at her.
MELANIE
(imitating them)
Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is
an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.
She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then
peers out of the side window.
LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin
column of smoke is climbing the sky.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to
put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She
picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the
cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee
and then breathes deeply of the air.
CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE
fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have
not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.
LONG SHOT - MITCH
on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke
is climbing the sky.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the
end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off
the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the
sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs
as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky
for a moment.
SLOW PAN
as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in
sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in
its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin
column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and
raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts
the rake down and begins walking toward the house.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch
coming toward her, her eyes glowing.
FULL SHOT - MITCH
closer to the house now.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
waiting, anticipating.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR
CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the
garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS
again. She turns.
Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing
a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MITCH
I wanted to change my shirt.
Melanie is uncomprehending.
MITCH
It smelled of the fire.
MELANIE
(nodding)
It's hard to believe anything at all
happened yesterday, isn't it? It's
so beautiful and still now.
(pause; then sagely)
I think I've got it all figured out,
by the way.
MITCH
Really? Tell me about it.
MELANIE
(secretively)
It's an uprising.
MITCH
Of birds?
MELANIE
Certainly, of birds.
Mitch grins.
MELANIE
It all started several months ago
with a peasant sparrow up in the
hills, a malcontent. He went around
telling all the other sparrows that
human beings weren't fit to rule
this planet, preaching wherever anyone
would listen...
MITCH
Growing a beard...
MELANIE
(delighted)
Yes, of course, he had to have a
beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!'
he kept saying, over and over...
MITCH
So they united.
MELANIE
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows
out for kicks...
MITCH
Well, they'll go along with anything.
MELANIE
Sure. But eventually, even the more
serious-minded birds began to listen.
"Why should humans rule?" they asked
themselves.
MITCH
Hear!
MELANIE
Why should we submit ourselves to
their domination?
MITCH
Hear, hear!
MELANIE
And all the while, that sparrow was
getting in his little messages.
Birds of the world, unite!
MITCH
Take wing!
MELANIE
You have nothing to lose but your
feathers.
They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then
laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly
still.
MITCH
(attempting to be
serious)
What it was, probably...
MELANIE
Mmm?
MITCH
They're probably hungry, that's all.
This was a bad summer. They eat
berries and... and nuts, you know,
and the hills are all burned out, so
they're probably searching for food
wherever they can get it.
MELANIE
With my little sparrow leading team.
She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.
Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror
story, they are becoming a little frightened.
MITCH
It's so damn quiet out there.
MELANIE
It was like that yesterday.
MITCH
What do you mean?
MELANIE
After the gulls attacked.
MITCH
I hadn't thought of that.
(pause)
And then the swifts came.
MELANIE
It makes you feel as if they're...
they're waiting or... resting...
or....
MITCH
(trying to make it
light again)
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie.
Your sparrow is standing on a soap
box and...
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
her face dead serious.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
MITCH
...waving his little wings...
His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the
garden is silent.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming
slowly and with the chill of horror on them.
MELANIE
They were angry, Mitch. They came
out of the chimney in fury.
(pause)
I had the feeling they wanted each
and every one of us dead.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes
to him longingly.
MITCH
Melanie, Melanie...
MELANIE
I'm frightened, Mitch.
MITCH
No, no...
MELANIE
I'm frightened and confused and I...
I think I want to go back to San
Francisco where there are buildings
and... and concrete and...
MITCH
Melanie...
MELANIE
...everything I know.
She looks up at him suddenly.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
MELANIE
Oh damn it, why did you have to walk
into that shop?
They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,
DISSOLVE
EXT. FAWCETT FARM - FULL SHOT - THE RED PICKUP TRUCK
Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name
of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate.
Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She
knocks. There is no answer.
MED. SHOT - LYDIA
LYDIA
Dan?
She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a
little away from the house.
LYDIA
Dan?
There is no answer. She shades her eyes and looks out over
the fields.
LONG SHOT - FARMHAND ON TRACTOR
FULL SHOT - THE BARNYARD
as Lydia crosses to a fence and cups her hands to her mouth.
LYDIA
(shouting)
Hi, there!
LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND
He stops the tractor, turns toward Lydia, shading his eyes.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
LYDIA
(shouting)
Is Mr. Fawcett home?
LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND
FARMHAND
(shouting back)
I think so, ma'm. His missus is in
Santa Cruz, but he ought to be here.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
LYDIA
Have you seen him this morning?
LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND FARMHAND
No, ma'm. I reckon he's in there, though.
MED. SHOT - LYDIA
LYDIA
(shouting it)
Thank you!
FULL SHOT - LYDIA
as she crosses the barnyard again. There are several chickens
scurrying about. She walks closer to them, sees an open bag
of feed lying against the fence.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
getting an idea.
MED. SHOT - LYDIA
reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the
ground.
LYDIA
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN
He struts up to the scattered grain.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
watching him.
CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN
He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from
it and struts off.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction
strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett. She turns.
FULL SHOT - LYDIA
approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.
LYDIA
Dan?
She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent.
In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.
LYDIA
Dan? Are you home?
No answer.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
a little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window
closest to the door.
CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW
A small pane of glass is broken.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
puzzled.
FULL SHOT - LYDIA
going to the front door, trying the knob.
MED. SHOT - LYDIA
The door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the
house.
LYDIA
Dan?
The house is still and silent.
INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT
as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the
right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her
left and looks down a long corridor.
FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial
light into the corridor.
LYDIA
Dan?
No answer.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she
should leave. A determined look comes over her face.
FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the
opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.
LYDIA
Dan? Are you in there?
No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing
the door open.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room.
SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and
continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A
standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still
burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass
shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane
of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its
top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped
out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near
decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser,
all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS,
and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass,
continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its
PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single
bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas,
one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately
CUTS TO:
CLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT
His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their
empty staring sockets. Immediately
CUT TO:
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
a terrified scream erupting from her mouth.
FULL SHOT - LYDIA
turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in
an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she
is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips
her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still
screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she
backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,
CAMERA FOLLOWING. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.
FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK
at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the
highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite
direction, swerves, screeches around the curve.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.
FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV
through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend
leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield,
there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in
the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and
barrels into the front yard.
FULL SHOT - MITCH
alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck
just as it jerks to a stop.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia.
MITCH
(alarmed)
What is it?
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
as he sees his mother.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
slumped on the wheel of the car, her head on her arms,
sobbing. On her sobs...
DISSOLVE
INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.
She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set
with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the
kitchen.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MITCH
That was Al on the phone. He wants
me to meet him out at the Fawcett
place. Says some detectives from
Santa Rosa'll be there in a little
while.
(pause)
Will you be all right here?
MELANIE
Yes. I was just taking her in some
tea.
He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses
her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to
him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.
MELANIE
Be careful. Please.
She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long,
full kiss.
FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN
as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and
then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his
car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen,
through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on
the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.
LYDIA (O.S.)
Mitch?
FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM
This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a
life no longer valid. There are photographs of her dead
husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of
Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct
femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing
the tray.
MELANIE
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought
you might like some tea.
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
LYDIA
Oh, thank you.
There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed,
arranges the pillows behind Lydia.
LYDIA
Where's Mitch?
MELANIE
Al Malone wanted him out at the
Fawcett farm.
LYDIA
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
MELANIE
He was calling from the farm, Mrs.
Brenner.
LYDIA
Then he saw.
MELANIE
He must have. He sent for the Santa
Rosa police.
LYDIA
What good will they do?
She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie
walks to the window and looks out over the bay.
LYDIA
Do you think Cathy's all right?
MELANIE
What?
LYDIA
Cathy. At the school.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression
clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all
right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting
smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.
MELANIE
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA
LYDIA
Do I sound foolish to you?
MELANIE
No.
LYDIA
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.
(she shudders)
They have such big windows at the
school.
(pause)
All the windows were broken. In Dan's
bedroom. All the windows.
MELANIE
Try not to think of that, Mrs.
Brenner.
LYDIA
I wish I were a stronger person.
There is a long awkward silence. She
sips at her tea reflectively.
LYDIA
I lost my husband four years ago,
you know.
(pause)
It's odd how you depend on someone
for strength, and then suddenly all
the strength is gone, and you're
alone.
(pause)
I'd love to relax some time. I'd
love to be able to sleep.
(pause; the worried
look again)
Do you think Cathy's all right?
MELANIE
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
LYDIA
I'm not this way, you know. Not
usually. I don't fuss and fret over
my children.
(pause)
When Frank died...
(pause)
You see, he knew the children, he
really knew them. He had the knack
of being able to enter into their
world, of becoming a part of them.
That's a rare talent.
MELANIE
Yes.
LYDIA
I wish I could be that way.
There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in
this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her
husband's death, is discussing it with another person.
Curiously, the person is Melanie.
LYDIA
(honestly and simply)
I miss him.
(pause)
You know, sometimes I wake up in the
morning, and I think 'I have to make
Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get
up and there's a... a very good reason
for getting out of bed until... until,
of course, I remember.
(pause)
I miss talking to him.
(pause)
Cathy's a child, you know, and
Mitch...
(she shrugs a little
sadly)
...Mitch has his own life.
(pause)
I'm glad he stayed here today. I
feel safer with him here.
(she sighs deeply)
MELANIE
Would you like to rest now, Mrs.
Brenner.
LYDIA
No. No... don't go yet.
(pause)
I feel as if I... I don't understand
you. And I want so much to understand.
MELANIE
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
LYDIA
Because my son is...
(pause)
My son seems to be fond of you.
(pause)
And I...
(pause)
I'm not quite sure how I feel about
it. I really don't know if I... like
you or not.
MELANIE
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?
You liking me?
LYDIA
Yes, I think so. My son is important
to me. I want to like any girl he
chooses.
MELANIE
And if you don't?
LYDIA
(with a faint smile)
Then I don't suppose it'll matter
much to anyone but me.
MELANIE
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
LYDIA
(shaking her head)
Mitch has always done exactly what
he wanted to do.
(pause)
I'm not complaining. That's the mark
of a man. But...
(pause)
You see, I... I wouldn't want to
be... be left alone. I don't think I
could bear being left alone. I...
forgive me. This business with the
birds has me upset. I... I don't
know what I'd do if Mitch weren't
here.
MELANIE
(going to the bed;
adjusting the pillow)
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.
Brenner.
LYDIA
(sighing)
I wish I were stronger.
(she pauses and looks
toward the window.)
Do you think she's all right? Do you
think she's safe at the school?
MELANIE
Would you like me to go for her?
LYDIA
I couldn't ask you to.
MELANIE
I don't mind, really.
LYDIA
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
MELANIE
I'll just clear up here, and then
dress.
She picks up the tray and starts for the door.
LYDIA
Melanie?
At the door, Melanie turns.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
her face soft.
LYDIA
(gently)
Thank you for the tea.

corridor. The children's VOICES are LOUDER now.
CHILDREN (O.S.)
She combed her hair but once a year.

With every rake, she shed a tear.
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity,

Melanie is at the door to Annie's room now. She opens the
door and looks in.

leading the children in song. She catches sight of Melanie
at the door. Melanie wiggles her fingers. Annie points to
her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few
minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside.
Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again.
EXT. SCHOOL - MED. PANNING SHOT
Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house.
Inside the children are still singing.

CLOSE UP - MELANIE
head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is
no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing
inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her
cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the
school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time
so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going
on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what
seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is
drawn to something above her.
MED. SHOT - SKY
A crows is coming down.

MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD
A crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the CAMERA
FOLLOWS it down, we see for the first time that the number
of crows has increased to an alarming number - almost 200 or
even perhaps 250. This last crow settles down with the others.
CHILDREN (O.S.)

CAMERA FOLLOWS her for a few paces and then STOPS so that
her image becomes smaller as she goes up steps into
EXT. PLAY YARD - DOLLY SHOT
A side view of the crows as seen by Melanie.
FULL SHOT - THE INTERIOR CORRIDOR
Melanie in headlong flight toward Annie's room.
ANNIE (O.S.)
All right, children. Now please put
your books in your desks, and bring
the songsheets to the front of the
room. No one's going out to play
until I have all the songsheets.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
Annie is lining the children up near the door leading to the
play yard.
ANNIE
We're not going outside until we
quiet down. Ralph? Did you hear me?
The children mutter for a moment, and then are still.
ANNIE
All right now.
She begins opening the play yard door. Suddenly, the door
from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly
INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of
the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
ANNIE
wh...?
TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE
against a background of children's VOICES, as they react to
this new excitement.
MELANIE
Outside.
LONG SHOT - THE CROWS - THROUGH THE WINDOWS TWO SHOT - ANNIE
AND MELANIE
MELANIE
We've got to get the children out of
here. These big windows... there's
no way to board them up.
Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows. One moves
restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again.
ANNIE
Quiet down, children! Quiet down!
The children modulate into silence.
ANNIE
Miss Daniels wants to see how we
conduct ourselves during a fire drill.
I'd like you to...
CHILDREN
(grumbling in Unison)
A fire drill? This is our play period,
Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz! Etc.
ANNIE
I'd like you to show her how quiet
and obedient you can be.
The children again fall silent.
ANNIE
We're going to go out of the school
now. Those of you who live nearby
can go directly home. I want the
rest of you to go down the hill, all
the way to the hotel. Do you
understand?
CHILDREN
All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss
Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do
we...?
ANNIE
(shushing them)
I want you to go as quietly as you
can, not a sound, until I tell you
to run. And then I want you to run
as fast as you can. Does everyone
understand?
(pause - silence)
All right. John, would you lead the
class, please?
The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens
it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the
play yard.
CLOSE SHOT - A SINGLE CROW
fluttering at the window, almost in exploration. He hangs
there for a moment, then wings back to the playground
equipment.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
MELANIE

DISSOLVE
INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT
It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as
DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his
wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A
DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of
booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in
his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and
efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another
table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing
and clowning around throughout following at a table in the
rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the
counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.
Over her head, the television set is blasting with its
perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.
MELANIE
Daddy, there were hundreds of them.
No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying
to tell you this as calmly as I know
how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.
(she takes a deep
breath)
Just now. Not... fifteen minutes
ago.
The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing
walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking
woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through
foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what
Melanie is saying.
MELANIE
At the school. No, I don't. Just a
minute.
(to Deke)
What's the name of the school?
DEKE
Just the Bodega Bay School.
(to Mrs. Bundy)
Help you, Mrs. Bundy?
MRS. BUNDY
I need some change, Mr. Carter.
As Deke opens cash register...
MELANIE
The Bodega Bay School.
(to Deke)
Could you turn that down, please?
Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.
MELANIE
I don't know how many children.
Thirty or forty. Yes.
Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to
Melanie.
MELANIE
No, the birds didn't attack until
the children were outside the school.
Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy.
Is there a difference between crows
and blackbirds?
MRS. BUNDY
(turning from machine)
There is very definitely a difference,
Miss.
MELANIE
They're different, Daddy.
(to Mrs. Bundy)
Thank you.
(into phone)
I think these were crows. Yes,
hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked
the children, attacked them.
(exasperated)
Daddy, a little girl was sent to the
hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all
right, but you act as if I'm... all
right, all right.
(pause)
No, I can't come home now. I just
can't, Daddy. How is it there? I
mean... are there birds? In the sky?
But no trouble. Well, I hope...
(pause)
I don't know when. I simply can't
leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.
All right, Daddy, good-by.
She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.
MRS. BUNDY
They're both perching birds, of
course, but of quite different
species. The crow is brachyrhynchos.
The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
MELANIE
Thank you.
(to Deke)
Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
DEKE
In the book right here, Miss.
As Melanie looks it up...
DEKE
(to Mrs. Bundy)
I don't see what difference it makes,
Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If
they attacked the school, that's
pretty serious.
MRS. BUNDY
(with a superior smile)
I hardly think either species would
have the intelligence to launch a
massed attack. Their brain pans aren't
large enough for such...
MELANIE
(dialing)
I just came from the school, madam.
I don't know about their brain pans
but...
MRS. BUNDY
Birds are not aggressive creatures,
Miss. They bring beauty to the world.
It is mankind, rather, who...
HELEN
(going to door leading
to kitchen)
Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.
Baked potato on all of them.
LAUGHTER from salesman at table.
MELANIE
(into phone)
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner,
please?
(pause)
Yes, I'll wait.
MRS. BUNDY
(continuing to Deke)
...insist on making it difficult for
life to survive on this planet. If
it weren't for birds...
DEKE
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to
understand. This young lady says
there was an attack on the school.
MRS. BUNDY
Impossible.
MELANIE
(in background)
Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.
Something terrible has happened.
Her background conversation continues through following:
DRUNK
(suddenly)
It's the end of the world!
HELEN
What's this about the school?
DEKE
Bunch of crows attacked the school,
Helen.
DRUNK
It's the end of the world.
(suddenly quoting)
"Thus saith the Lord God to the
mountains, and to the hills, to the
rivers and to the valleys; Behold,
I, even I, will bring a sword upon
you, and I will destroy your high
places.
HELEN
The Lord's not destroying anything,
Jason.
DRUNK
"In all your dwelling places, the
cities shall be laid waste, and the
high places shall be laid waste!"
(he nods)
Ezekiel, Chapter six.
HELEN
(quoting)
"Woe unto them that rise up early in
the morning that they may follow
strong drink."
DRUNK
(nodding)
Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of
the world.
MELANIE
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.
Good-by.
(she hangs up)
MRS. BUNDY
(laughing)
I hardly think a few birds are going
to bring about the end of the world.
MELANIE
(turning to her)
These weren't a few birds.
CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN
waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation;
becoming very nervous.
BACK TO SCENE
DEKE
I didn't even know there were many
crows in Bodega Bay this time of
year.
MRS. BUNDY
The crow is a permanent resident
throughout its range. In fact, during
our Christmas Count, we recorded...
CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES
eating.
SHOLES
(suddenly, from his
table)
How many gulls did you count, Mrs.
Bundy?
BACK TO SCENE
MRS. BUNDY
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are
several varieties.
SHOLES
The ones that've been raising the
devil with my fishing boats.
MRS. BUNDY
Probably herring gulls. They arrive
in November, you know, and don't
migrate North again until March or...
MELANIE
(leaping upon this)
Have you had trouble with gulls?
SHOLES
One of my boats did last week.
DEKE
(making a connection)
This young lady got hit by a gull
only Saturday.
SAM'S VOICE
(from kitchen)
Pick up the chicken.
HELEN
Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was
crows.
(she picks up tray,
shrugs, goes to table)
Deke, I'm still waiting for those
Bloody Marys!
DEKE
Coming right up!
CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN
as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really
frightened.
WOMAN
Could you ask them to lower their
voices, please? They're frightening
the children.
LITTLE GIRL
Timmy has a canary.
HELEN
That's nice. Are you Timmy?
LITTLE BOY
My cousin is Timmy.
BACK TO SCENE
SAM'S VOICE
(leaving table, coming
to bar)
A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized
one of my boats. Practically tore
of the skipper's arm.
HELEN
(coming back)
You're scaring the kids. Keep it
low.
DEKE
You're scaring me, too. Are you trying
to say all these...
(he shakes his head)
That sounds impossible, Sebastian.
SHOLES
I'm only telling you what happened
to my boat.
MRS. BUNDY
The gulls were after your fish, Mr.
Sholes. Really, let's be logical
about this.
MELANIE
What were the crows after at the
school?
MRS. BUNDY
What do you think they were after,
Miss...?
MELANIE
Daniels. I think they were after the
children.
MRS. BUNDY
For what purpose?
MELANIE
To...
(she hesitates)
To kill them.
There is a long silence.
MRS. BUNDY
Why?
Another silence.
MELANIE
I don't know why.
MRS. BUNDY
I thought not. Birds have been on
this planet since archaeopteryx,
Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty
million years ago!
A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.
MRS. BUNDY
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait
all that time to start a... a war
against humanity?
MELANIE
No one called it a war!
SALESMAN
Scotch, light on the water.
MRS. BUNDY
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying
as much.
HELEN
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
SHOLES
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.
(to Mrs. Bundy)
Who said anything about war? All I
said was that some gulls...
HELEN
(yelling to kitchen)
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
SHOLES
No. ...came down on one of my boats.
They could have been after the fish,
just as you said.
SALESMAN
Your captain should have shot at
them.
SHOLES
What?
SALESMAN
Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most
birds are. If you ask me, we should
wipe them all out. World would be
better off without them.
MRS. BUNDY
(outraged)
Birds?
SALESMAN
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a
mess of everything. Who needs them?
MRS. BUNDY
We need them.
SALESMAN
Not if they're starting a war.
MRS. BUNDY
They are incapable of organized
warfare!
MELANIE
Have you ever seen a jay protecting
a nest?
MRS. BUNDY
I have seen jays doing everything it
is conceivable for jays to do.
Ornithology happens to be my
avocation, Miss Daniels. You're
talking about preservation of the
species, a hen protecting her young.
There's a vast difference between...
MELANIE
Maybe they're all protecting the
species. Maybe they're tired of being
shot at and roasted in ovens and...
MRS. BUNDY
Are you discussing gamebirds now?
All birds are not gamebirds, you
know.
MELANIE
I don't know anything about birds
except that they're attacking this
town.
SALESMAN
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns
and wipe them off the face of the
earth.
MRS. BUNDY
That would hardly be possible.
DEKE
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
MRS. BUNDY
Because there are 8,650 species of
birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.
It's estimated that five billion,
seven hundred and fifty million birds
live in the United States alone. The
five continents of the world...
SALESMAN
(muttering)
Kill them all. Get rid of them.
Messy animals.
MRS. BUNDY
...probably contain more than a
hundred billion birds!
DRUNK
It's the end of the world!
DEKE
Well, we seem to have more than our
share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.
Maybe this young lady's right. Maybe
they've all gone crazy.
HELEN
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want
it at the table?
SHOLES
No. Here's fine.
(he begins eating)
HELEN
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
DEKE
Coming.
HELEN
(angrily)
Are we running a business here -- or
a bird sanctuary?
SHOLES
(beginning to change
his mind)
Actually, those gulls must have been
after the fish.
MRS. BUNDY
Of course.
SHOLES
Makes a lot more sense than... well,
an attack.
MRS. BUNDY
Of course it does. If we believe
that birds are attacking, why... why
next we'll believe that grasshoppers
and cockroaches are capable of...
DRUNK
Cockroaches! Urghh!
CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN
getting more and more anxious.
WOMAN
Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.
BOY
Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?
SHOLES
Maybe we're all getting a little
carried away by this. Admittedly, a
few birds acted strangely. That's no
reason to believe...
MELANIE
This isn't a few birds! I keep telling
you that! These are gulls and swifts
and crows and...
MRS. BUNDY
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
MELANIE
Maybe! Is it impossible?
MRS. BUNDY
Yes. I have never known birds of
different species to flock together.
The very concept is unimaginable.
(laughing)
Why if that happened, we wouldn't
have a chance. How could we possible
hope to fight them?
SHOLES
We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.
Bundy.
WOMAN
(calling from table)
Excuse me, may I have a check, please?
HELEN
(concerned)
Is everything all right, ma'am?
WOMAN
Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the
road.
SAM
(coming from kitchen)
What's the matter? Something wrong
out here?
DEKE
Nothing's wrong.
SAM
All this shouting.
MRS. BUNDY
We're fighting a war, Sam.
SAM
A war? Against who? Did the
Russians...?
SHOLES
Against birds.
WOMAN
(suddenly)
I'm glad you all think this is so
amusing. You've frightened my children
half out of their wits.
BOY
I'm not scared, Mommy.
WOMAN
Keep quiet. If that young lady saw
an attack on the school, why won't
you believe her?
SAM
What attack? Who attacked the school?
WOMAN
Birds did. Crows! And you're all
sitting around here debating! What
do you want them to do next? Crash
through that window?
LITTLE GIRL
(frightened by her
mother)
Mommy!
WOMAN
Quiet! Why don't you all get home?
Lock your doors and windows!
(her hysteria rising)
Put on your coats, children!
(to Deke)
What's the fastest road to San
Francisco?
DEKE
The freeway, ma'am.
WOMAN
Where do I get it?
SALESMAN
I'm going out that way, lady. You
can follow me.
WOMAN
Then let's go. Now!
SALESMAN
I haven't finished my drink.
WOMAN
(on edge of panic,
shouting at her
children)
Put on your coats! Do you want to
get trapped here?
BOY
I can't find my scarf.
WOMAN
Look in your sleeve!
The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.
MITCH
Melanie?
At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.
MITCH
(going to her)
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's Cathy?
MELANIE
At Annie's house. She's all right.
SAM
Al, why aren't you over there where
the attack was?
MALONE
Because I just got back from Dan
Fawcett's place, that's why.
MITCH
He was killed last night. By birds.
MALONE
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know
that for a fact.
MRS. BUNDY
What are the facts, Mr. Malone?
MALONE
Santa Rosa police think it was a
felony murder. They think a burglar
broke in and killed him.
WOMAN
Were the Santa Rosa police at your
school today?
(impatiently, to
salesman)
Are you coming?
SALESMAN
Take it easy, lady.
(through window)
There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
DRUNK
(quoting)
"Look at the birds of the air: they
do not sow or read, yet your heavenly
father feeds them."
WOMAN
I'll never feed another bird as long
as I live!
SALESMAN
Something like this happened in Santa
Cruz last year. The town was covered
with seagulls.
WOMAN
Can't you please finish your drink?
MRS. BUNDY
That's right, sir, I recall it. A
large flock of seagulls got lost in
a fog and headed in for the town,
where all the lights were.
SALESMAN
They made some mess, too, smashing
into houses and everything.
(shaking his head)
They always make a mess. We're better
off without them.
MRS. BUNDY
The point is that no one seemed to
get upset about it. They were gone
the next morning, just as if nothing
at all had happened. Poor things.
WOMAN
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
SALESMAN
All right, all right!
(he downs his drink)
Hope you figure this out, folks.
DRUNK
It's the end of the world.
The Tides is silent for a moment.
SHOLES
Well, I'd better get back to the
cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?
DEKE
Let's see. Scallops and coffee...
MITCH
Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.
Sholes turns to him.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
his face very serious.
MITCH
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
SHOLES
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
MITCH
(flatly)
I think we're in trouble. I don't
know how or why this started, but I
know it's here and I know we'd be
crazy to ignore it.
MRS. BUNDY
(sarcastically)
Ignore what? The bird war?
MITCH
(exploding)
Yes, the bird war, the bird attack,
the bird plague, you can call it
what you want to, they're out there
massing someplace and they'll be
back, you can count on that!
MRS. BUNDY
Ridiculous!
MITCH
Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home
and polish your binoculars?
SAM
Go on, Mitch.
MITCH
If we don't do something now, if we
don't get Bodega Bay on the move...
SHOLES
Look, Mitch, even if this is true,
even if all the birds...
MITCH
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
SHOLES
(after a long pause)
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't
see any reason for it.
MITCH
It's happening. Isn't that a good
enough reason?
SHOLES
(thoughtfully)
I like Bodega Bay as well as any
man. If I thought...
(he shakes his head)
MITCH
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an
important man in this town. If you'll
help, the rest will.
SHOLES
Help how? What do you want to do?
MITCH
I'm not sure, but...
SHOLES
If you don't even know what you want
to do...
MELANIE
Listen to him, please.
SAM
(taking position beside
Melanie)
You listen to him, Sebastian!
MITCH
I only know we've got to drive them
away from town -- before they drive
us away.
SHOLES
How?
MITCH
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about
Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting
lost in the fog, and heading in for
the lights.
DEKE
We don't have any fog this time of
year, Mitch.
MITCH
We'll make our own fog.
SHOLES
How do you plan to do that?
MITCH
With smoke.
MALONE
There's an ordinance against burning
anything in this town, unless it's...
MITCH
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army
uses.
DEKE
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad
as birds.
MRS. BUNDY
Birds are not bad!
SHOLES
How can we go on living here if we
blanket the town with smoke?
MITCH
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Pause. They are silent.
SAM
(slowly)
It's worth a try, Sebastian.
There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:
MELANIE
Look!
They turn toward the window.
TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT
Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or
four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of
the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the
window and out to the left.
DEKE
(alarmed)
Gulls!
MITCH
They're back!
SHOLES
They're only the usual... What are
you...
TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT
The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the
attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is
seen disappearing into the men's room.
INT. TIDES
A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the
Tides Restaurant.
TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT
A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man
on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and
then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out
and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep
by. The gas begins to flow away.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie
after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see
people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas
station. At the door, Mitch turns.
MITCH
(to Melanie)
Stay back in here.
Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.
They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at
the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the
window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to
rescue the attacked gas station attendant.
Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter
away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in
the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks
down.
TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT
on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is
flowing to the right into the car park.
CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE
flowing down to the car park.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.
MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS
along the flowing gas back to the station.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
She turns back to the car park.
FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked
below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up,
has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of
lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the
happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn
attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the
man.
FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As
he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and
he drops it.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
Her horror-stricken face.
FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA
Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's
car, and the one next to it go up in flames.
CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE
TURNING TO SEE
FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION
The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars,
following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump,
which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured
attendant.
EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT
A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the
town rushing around the car park and the streets across the
highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see
automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil
smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the
parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and
have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the
foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill
with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes
obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop
down on the town.
EXT. TIDES TOWN
A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone
booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing
out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin
to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the
restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:
MELANIE
Mitch...! Mitch!
We see her look up to the sky.
LONG SHOT - THE SKY
The sky is full of seagulls.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again
to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in
the phone booth.
CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE
slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all
around her.
EXT. TIDES TOWN
From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people
who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with
clouds of birds coming on them.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her
eyes for Mitch.
MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the
direction of the car park.
EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water
from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning
cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around
them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
Her eyes turn up quickly.
LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT
We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.
Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.
EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT
We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner
coming toward her in the phone booth. We can see birds flying
in and out of the windows of the car. We can see the arm
and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the
background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.
CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE
as the car comes toward her in the booth.
EXT. TIDES TOWN
At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.
CLOSER SHOT
A side view of the car after practically scraping the side
of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the
driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently
give us a view of its interior.
FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE
watching the car.
EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It
explodes.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.
TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT
She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no
avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down
and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight
turn, now sees:
THE TIDES TOWN
The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop
their hose.
CLOSER SHOT
shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the
water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows
of the phone booth.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window
she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the
left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its
palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and
leaping and kicking its van to pieces.
At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of
a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.
His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are
covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.
Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides
Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter,
the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and
waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of
recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls
crash around the booth causing her to go back.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE
looking out again toward Mitch.
EXT. TIDES TOWN
Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction
while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning
building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station.
Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the
smoking building.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
looking across in horror.
LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING
For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly
Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls
down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office,
another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the
window as Mitch drops the child.
FLASH - MELANIE
watching this breathlessly.
CLOSER SHOT
The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.
He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the
windows. They disappear into the building.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
holding her breath.
LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING
No sign of Mitch.
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
getting more desperate.
CLOSEUP - BUILDING
No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window
and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.
LONG SHOT - MITCH
sees her and starts running toward the booth.
HIGH SHOT - MITCH
beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.
LOW SHOT
close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag
Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the
CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.
INT. THE TIDES
There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the
windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The
CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very
hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.
There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can
hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a
woman's voice SCREAMS out:
WOMAN
Why are they doing it?! Why are they
doing it...?!
Some of the heads of the group turn.
CLOSE SHOT
It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.
Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and
helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some
words.
MRS. BUNDY
([Mrs. Bundy offers a
weak explanation of
why the birds could
have gone berserk
like this. This
information should
be obtained from Dr.
Stager.])
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over
their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.
MITCH
(looking up)
I think they're going.
Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud
CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.
MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
And past the heads of the other people who have also turned,
we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has
gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who
are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the
window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the
street.
MITCH
I think it's safe to get out now.
MELANIE
Don't let's take any chances.
MITCH
We've got to get Cathy.
They open the door and make their way out into the street,
running and looking about them desperately.
EXT. BODIGA STREET
There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched
on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the
sidewalk.
EXT. BODIGA STREET
There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as
they move along past the last street and come into the more
countrified part of the town.
LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD
We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which
we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the
school roof.
SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks
up, Melanie following his look.
SKY SHOT - FULL
of wheeling gulls.
SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the
school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.
LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT
There are a few blackbirds on it.
MELANIE'S VOICE
Look... the crows again.
CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.
MELANIE
Careful, Mitch. The crows may be
back in the play yard.
CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play
yard, we see what they see.
MED. SHOT
THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of
crows.
CLOSE SHOT
They walk stealthily past.
CLOSE SHOT
CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.
CLOSE SHOT
Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they
approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over
her shoulder toward the crows.
EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE
Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.
LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE
A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the
door.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
He reaches the body. He rolls it over.
QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
dead.
QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
The shock registering on his face.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment
what Mitch's reaction will be.
MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's
face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket
and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to
keep her warm. He turns away then.
MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW
with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign,
with her eyes peering at something outside.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
turning to follow Cathy's gaze.
CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS
Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.
FULL SHOT - THE ROAD
As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at
the birds. Melanie dashes forward.
MELANIE
(as the birds flutter
into the air)
Mitch! Don't!
She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he
maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are
now hovering flight.
MELANIE
Please! Get Cathy! Let's get out of
here!
Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the
house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a
state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds
Cathy to her.
CLOSER THREE SHOT
as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.
MELANIE
Mitch, you can't leave her out there.
He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder
is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and
then a door is CLOSED.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer
in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.
MED. SHOT
He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the
three of them as they silently make their way past the crows
once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out
cautiously to the right.
MED. SHOT
CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.
BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE
They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.
MED. SHOT
Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.
CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE
The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go
toward the waiting car.
MED. SHOT
They arrive at the car.
MELANIE
You drive, Mitch.
She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch
slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the
CAMERA and goes down the school road.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR
Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie
looks over her shoulder.
MELANIE
(holding her breath)
I don't think they're coming.
Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes
wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then
suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as
the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.
CATHY
On our way back from taking Michele
home... we... we heard the explosion
and went outside to... see what...
what it was.
(pause)
All at once the... the birds were
everywhere. All at once. She... she
pushed me inside and... they covered
her.
(pause)
Annie.
(pause)
She pushed me inside.
TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE
as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.
DISSOLVE
CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA
TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings
to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues
low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting
there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd,
not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the
Brenner house in the distance.
FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE
Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed
across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two
attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.
LONG SHOT - THE BAY
covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is
still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where
the ladder leans against the side of the house.
FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE
as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner,
carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She
is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is
not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her
hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked
with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there
is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she
stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.
MELANIE
The town looks clear.
MITCH
The bay doesn't.
MELANIE
How long have they been gathering
there?
MITCH
The past fifteen minutes.
(pause)
It seems to be a pattern, doesn't
it? They strike and disappear, and
then they start massing again.
Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.
MELANIE
I keep thinking of Annie.
(she squeezes her
eyes shut)
MITCH
(after a long pause)
It... it doesn't look very different,
does it? A little smoke over the
town, but otherwise...
MELANIE
(looking)
Even the birds sitting out there.
It does look very much the same,
Mitch. This could be last week.
MITCH
It may not be last week again for a
long long time.
They are both silent.
MELANIE
Look. They're still coming.
Mitch nods. Silence.
MITCH
Do you want to try your father again?
(Melanie shakes her
head. Puzzled, Mitch
looks at her)
MELANIE
I tried a little while ago. The
phone's dead.
MITCH
Have we still got power?
MELANIE
Yes.
(leaning against him)
I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very
tired.
LYDIA (O.S.)
Mitch! I'm getting something on the
radio!
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT
Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a
footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the
room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from
the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them
LYDIA
I can't get any of the local stations.
I think this is San Francisco.
ANNOUNCER
...would include formulation of a
central financing committee to handle
credit and to allocate responsibility
for the various facets of the project.
A vote on the motion is expected
early tomorrow morning.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
listening.
ANNOUNCER
Continuing with the local news, police
are still investigating the series
of valuable jade burglaries in the
Chinatown area. The round-up of known
criminals has not as yet produced a
suspect, but Commissioner Nelson
said today he was certain the
burglaries were quote linked and the
work of the team of professionals
unquote.
(pause)
In Bodega Bay early this morning, a
large flock of crows attacked a group
of children who were leaving the
school during a fire drill. One little
girl was seriously injured and taken
to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but
the majority of children reached
safety in the town.
(pause)
On the national scene today, the
opening of the new session of Congress
was marked by a State of the Union
address that...
MITCH
Is that all?
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
...drew a standing ovation for the
President. The Chief Executive, in
discussing our relation to Europe
and the rest of the world community
said: "These various elements of our
foreign policy lead as I have said
to a single goal --
MITCH
(sighing)
We're going to need more wood for
the fire. We can't let it go out.
ANNOUNCER
(continuing as drone
in background)
The goal of a peaceful world of free
and independent states. This is our
guide for the present and our vision
for the future -- a free community
of nations, independent but
interdependent, uniting north and
south, east and west, in one great
family of man, outgrowing and
transcending the hates and fears
that rend our age. We will not reach
that goal today or tomorrow. We may
not reach it in our lifetime. But
the quest is the great adventure of
our century. We sometimes chafe at
the burdens of our obligations, the
complexity of our decisions, the
agony of our choices, but there is
no comfort or security for us in
evasion, no solution in abdication,
no relief in irresponsibility.
(pause)
In assuming the tasks of the
Presidency, I said that few
generations, in all history, had
been granted the role of being the
great defender of freedom in its
hour of maximum danger. This is our
good fortune, and I welcome it now
as I did when I first took office.
(pause)
For it is the fate of this generation --
Of you in the Congress and of me as
President -- to live with a struggle
we did not start, in a world we did -
not make. But the pressures of life
are not always distributed by choice.
And while no nation has ever faced
such a challenge, no nation has ever
been ready to seize the burden and
the glory of...
LYDIA
(pause)
Did you you get the windows in the
attic, Mitch?
MITCH
I got them all, Mother.
LYDIA
When do you think they'll come?
MITCH
I don't know.
LYDIA
If there are... larger birds, Mitch...
they'll get into the house.
MITCH
That's a chance we have to take.
LYDIA
Maybe we ought to leave.
MITCH
Not now. Not while they're massing
out there.
LYDIA
When?
MITCH
I don't know when. We'll see what...
LYDIA
Where will we go?
MITCH
I don't know yet. I think we'll be
safe here.
(Pause)
Let's bring that wood in.
LYDIA
What happens when we run out of wood?
Music begins to play. The music is sweet, with violins and
long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the
tension being played in front of it.
MITCH
I don't know. We'll break up the
furni...
LYDIA
(shouting)
You don't know, you don't know!
When will you know? When we're all
dead? Like Annie?
CATHY
(shrieking it, her
face white)
Mother!
LYDIA
(at Mitch)
If your father were here...
MITCH
(sharply)
Mother! I'm trying my best!
(shaking his head)
I'm... trying... my...

(trembling, nodding)
I'm sorry, Mitch.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
the strain showing on his face. He nods briefly.
MITCH
Let's get the wood. Why don't you
make us all some coffee, Mother?
FULL SHOT - HOUSE
as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood.
There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they
begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly
scan the sky.
FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS
flying in tight formation.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MELANIE
Where are they heading?
MITCH
Inland.
MELANIE
Santa Rosa?
MITCH
Maybe.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face.
It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa
Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.
MITCH (O.S.)
(gently)
Come on. Let's get this wood in.
Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and
her eyes remain on the sky.
DISSOLVE
FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we
can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the
sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.
There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights,
kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace
putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room
and dumps another load.
MELANIE
That's the last of it.
LYDIA
Did you close the door?
MELANIE
And locked it.
CATHY
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in
here?
LYDIA
(snapping it)
No!
CATHY
Mom, they're in a cage!
LYDIA
They're birds!
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.
MITCH
(softly)
Let them stay in the other room.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
her hand trembling as she pours the coffee.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent
except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more
wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still
are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in
the house.
CATHY
Mitch? Why are they doing this? The
birds.
MITCH
(putting wood on fire)
I don't know, honey.
CATHY
Why are they trying to kill people?
MITCH
I wish I could say. But if I could
answer that, I could also tell you
why people are trying to kill people.
The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the
lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall
silent.
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
turning to look toward the other room, her face going white,
her eyes widening.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
waiting.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
waiting.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
waiting.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of
their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of
splintering glass.
LYDIA
Mitch...
MITCH
Shhh. Shhh.
Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING,
the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence. More panes
of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards
and the outside of the house begins building, almost like
muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm.
Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration,
is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section
entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the
roof.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She
squeezes her eyes shut.
TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE
as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds,
there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat
of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-
tat. Tat-
CATHY
(in terror)
I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I
want to throw...
Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.
MELANIE
I'll go with you.
They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR
Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling
of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of
birds striking the house.
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the
birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his
watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back
door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the
dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.
CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?
He cannot tell.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a
NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing
sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
coming into the entry hall.
CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR
The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside
assail the door.
FULL SHOT - MITCH
turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining
room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it
toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and
piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again,
CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags
it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table
when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with
alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is
and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of
desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The
CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din
now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.
MELANIE
When will they stop?
MITCH
I thought they'd have stopped by
now.
MELANIE
What time is it?
MITCH
Almost two a.m.
MELANIE
You must be exhausted.
MITCH
How about you?
She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room,
the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their
cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready
to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the
chair, goes to the cage.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
looking at the birds, wondering.
CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS
looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their
expressions. Malice or benevolence?
MED. SHOT - MITCH
He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.
CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS
watching, unmoving.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER
as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.
One of them tweets.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
MITCH
I wonder if Cathy fed them.
He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door,
takes out a small box of bird feed.
CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE
as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.
His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the
small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.
Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.
The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the
small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it
in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then,
tweeting, they begin to eat.
FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM
as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped
against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.
Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling,
pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.
MITCH
(holding her)
You should have left when you wanted
to.
She shakes her head.
MITCH
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
MELANIE
I don't want to be safe. I want to
be with you.
There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like
a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close,
Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand
in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of
night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.
MITCH
(in the darkness)
The power.
MELANIE
Mitch...
MITCH
Wait here. Don't move.
The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the
blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the
SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes
on.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as
he directs the beam upwards.
MITCH
We'd better light some of those lamps.
MELANIE
No... wait.
(pause)
Hold me.
In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is
almost black in the room except for the strange effect of
the flashlight as he holds it behind her.
MITCH
I think they're easing off.
DISSOLVE
FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the
fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep
on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.
Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly
and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer
the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another
SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a
steady dribbling, difficult to place.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.
MELANIE
(whispering)
Mitch?
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
as she turns toward him.
MELANIE
(still whispering)
Mitch?
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
asleep.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming
from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep,
picks up a very long flashlight.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the
entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled
against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into
the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam
on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor
outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters,
goes to the windows, plays the beam on them. Everything's
all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second
bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first
door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light
on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor,
goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to
the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back
toward the door when she stops.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
looking.
CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR
a pile of chipped and broken plaster.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.
CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING
A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face,
and suddenly, her eyes open wide.
CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL
sitting in the darkness, staring at her.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
reacting.
QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL
wings spread in the beam of light.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering
back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the
FULL SHOT - THE CEILING
a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward
her.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds
attack her.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.
MITCH (O.S.)
Melanie!
FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS
grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is
a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering
wings.
MITCH (O.S.)
Melanie, open the door!
He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie
struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed
by the birds.
She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the
spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering
of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault
on the door by Mitch outside.
LYDIA (O.S.)
(screaming)
Mitch, get her out of there!
MED. SHOT - THE ROOM
Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in
view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see
on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.
MITCH (O.S.)
Melanie!
The door begins to open.
FULL SHOT - MITCH
as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room. He
begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for
Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins
dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been
shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.
We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch
pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut
behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at
the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.
MITCH
Mother, get a rope!
LYDIA
Oh, my God, look at her!
MITCH
(shouting)
Get a rope!
She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.
There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He
will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his
hand, knocking the club from it.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his
hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.
Another bird flutters into the corridor.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his
hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and
is immediately attacked by the other bird.
MITCH
(yelling)
Mother! Hurry!
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a
heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily
to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and
compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the
doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to
the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to
Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia
following. As they go downstairs:
MITCH
Cathy! Get a blanket and some
bandages!
CATHY
(at the foot of the
stars, on the verge
of tears)
Is she all right?
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.
MELANIE
I'm... I'm....
FULL SHOT - MITCH
as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the
couch.
MITCH
Just lie there and keep still.
Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.
By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over
Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands
are trembling, and he drops it.
LYDIA
Let me do that, Mitch.
She picks up the bandage.
MITCH
I can handle it.
LYDIA
I know you can.
(her eyes meet his)
But I'd like to.
He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.
MELANIE
(weakly)
Please don't mess me up with bandages,
Mrs. Brenner.
LYDIA
Shhhh. Shhhh.
MELANIE
Please.
But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the
cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.
LYDIA
(as she works)
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
MITCH
You're doing fine.
LYDIA
(Apologizing)
I mean. I want to...
Pause.
CATHY
Listen!
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to
hear.
LYDIA
They're gone. God have mercy, they're
gone.
FULL SHOT - MITCH
as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the
table and chair. He opens the door a crack.
FULL SHOT - THE YARD
through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no
birds visible.
FULL SHOT - THE DOOR
from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred
and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds
spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is
directly behind him.
FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE
a shambles, all the windows broken.
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
MITCH
They're gone. The same pattern.
LYDIA
But they'll be back.
MITCH
We won't be here.
LYDIA
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no
place to go.
MITCH
I want to try for San Francisco.
There are buildings there. Steel and
concrete!
LYDIA
(shaking her head)
We'd never make it. They're probably
all over the road.
MITCH
We have to try it.
(a long silence)
We can't stay here.
(silence)
Melanie needs help.
(silence)
Mother, the house won't take another
attack.
LYDIA
If...
(pause)
If... when we get to San Francisco...
(pause)
If they're already there?
MITCH
They won't be.
LYDIA
If they are?
MITCH
We'll worry about that when we get
there.
LYDIA
I'm frightened, terribly frightened.
I... I don't know what's out there,
Mitch.
MITCH
What do we have to know, Mother?
We're all together, we all love each
other, we all need each other. What
else is there? Mother, I want us to
stay alive!
LYDIA
(nodding; then after
a pause)
I started to say... inside...
MITCH
You don't have to.
He holds out his hand to her.
MITCH
I think we'd better get started.
DISSOLVE
FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD
It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before
dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following
until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is
deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's
convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house
together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the
back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background
is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia
comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking
down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the
house.
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just
outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
looking back at her.
FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA
Across the expanse of the desolated yard.
CATHY
May I take them, Mitch?
He does not answer. She continues looking at him.
CATHY
They haven't harmed anyone.
LYDIA
Take them.
MITCH
(with a slow nod)
We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.
He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.
The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front
seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops,
and looks toward the trees.
MED. SHOT - THE TREES
covered with waiting birds.
MED. SHOT - MITCH
getting into car.
MITCH
Be careful with that door.
Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch
does the same with his door.
MELANIE
(weakly)
Mitch, if they hear the car
starting... if they see movement...
MITCH
We'll take it slow until we get to
the main road.
(pause)
Are you ready?
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND
turning the key. The motor springs to life.
FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
anticipation on all the faces.
MITCH
All right.
(he takes a deep breath)
Here we go.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is
still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it
passes the gate and starts down the road.
MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small
fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.
The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the
road.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW
She gasps quickly.
MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE
standing, waiting silently.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

MITCH
Shhh. Shhhh.
MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with
waiting seagulls.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
turning toward the side of the road ahead.
FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.
covered with waiting birds.
CATHY
(whispering)
Mitch, let's turn back.
MITCH
Shhh. Shhhhh.
MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE
as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front
porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his
hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded
window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
reacting.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.
as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding
road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
standing wires, watching, waiting.
FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as
the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of
birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every
pole, on every fence.
LYDIA
Mitch!
MED. SHOT - MITCH
as he stops the car and looks ahead.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
frightened, try not to reveal her fear.
MELANIE
Can we turn back?
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
MITCH
I... I don't think so. If we get
through town, I think we'll be all
right.
FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest
reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing,
who makes the decision.
MELANIE
Then go ahead, Mitch.
FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR
as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow
rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
as she turns to look out the window on her side.
CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS
as the car moves past them slowly.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
closing her eyes.
FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE
through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with
birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all
over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the
open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the
gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken
windows.
TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH
The tension on their faces,
MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES

merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere,
waiting.
CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN

arms.

HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR
navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it
in straight lines.
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over
their heads, letting in more light.
CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF
More slashes, more light in scattered beams.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the
memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the
owl.
CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF
more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the
incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
LYDIA
(almost a prayer)
Dear God... dear God... please,
please, what have we done? Please.
(and then in anger at
the roof and the
birds)
Can't they leave us alone?
(shrieking it)
LEAVE US ALONE!
MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof
suddenly rips back.
FULL SHOT - BIRDS
from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof
tears back.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds,
and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder.
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around
Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
racing along as the birds hover over it.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks
as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.
FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR
streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in
the road.
FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)
It is arrow-straight, no curves.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins
to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds
attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into
them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They
are well ahead of the birds now.
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
LYDIA
We're losing them.
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
only a nod, his face streaming tears.
LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.)
as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the
distance.
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release
of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles
Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening,
looks ahead through the windshield.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR
all their faces visible.
CATHY
Mitch? Do... do you think they'll
be all right? In the trunk? Can they
breath?
MITCH
(with the faintest
smile)
I think they'll be all right, honey.
There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the
wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension.
They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint
their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches
up to turn down the sun visor.
MITCH
It looks... it looks clear up ahead.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise
over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the
distance it goes.
FADE OUT:
THE END
FADE IN:
EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT
Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a
hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and
its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes.
We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over
traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business
buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we
approach downtown section, the character of the city begins
to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We
see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-
vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.
vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of
nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.
We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific
location. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its
exposed brick side great painted letters advertise "Transients-
Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough
to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open,
curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so
characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward
with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is
raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to
three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants
of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are
close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame
is in shot. No sounds come from within the room.
Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between
shade and sill, peep into the room.
A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears
a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude
of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of
the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome
conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl
nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.
A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure
visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then
start forward. As we pass under the window shade,
CUT TO:
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)
A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow
bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the
bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-
top handbag are on the bureau.
On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-
Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There
is no radio.
The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt
and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man
with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting
his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at
Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps
her face turned away from him.
After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans
over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly,
holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed
and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an
inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow
Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns
at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate,
playful voice.
SAM
Never did eat your lunch, did you.
Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her,
kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings
her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds
her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally
pulls away and sits up.
MARY
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours give my
boss excess acid.
She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings
out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or
perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam
watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery,
humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they
occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.
SAM
Call your boss and tell him you're
taking the rest of the afternoon
off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
MARY
(soft sarcasm)
What do I do with my free afternoon,
walk you to the airport?
SAM
(meaningfully)
We could laze around here a while
longer.
MARY
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels
of this sort aren't interested in
you when you come in, but when your
time's up...
(a small anguish)
Sam, I hate having to be with you in
a place like this.
SAM
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend occasional nights
in cheap hotels. They say it...
MARY
(interrupting)
When you're married you can do a lot
of things deliberately.
SAM
You sure talk like a girl who's been
married.
MARY
Sam!
SAM
I'm sorry, Mary.
(after a moment)
My old Dad used to say 'when you
can't change a situation, laugh at
it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like
laughing at it.
MARY
I've lost my girlish laughter.
SAM
(observing)
The only girlish thing you have lost.
MARY
(a meaningful quiet,
then, with difficulty:)
Sam. This is the last time.
SAM
For what?
MARY
This! Meeting you in secret so we
can be... secretive! You come down
here on business trips and we steal
lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't
even come.
SAM
Okay. What do we do instead, write
each other lurid love letters?
MARY
(about to argue, then
turning away)
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working
girl.
SAM
And I'm a working man! We're a regular
working-class tragedy!
(he laughs)
MARY
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we
go on meeting in shabby hotels
whenever you can find a tax-deductible
excuse for flying down deductible
here...
SAM
(interrupting,
seriously)
You can't laugh at it, huh?
MARY
Can you?
SAM
Sure. It's like laughing through a
broken jaw, but...
He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window,
tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.
It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room,
revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if
corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the
fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor
again.
SAM
And besides, when you say I make tax-
deductible excuses you make me out a
criminal.
MARY
(having to smile)
You couldn't be a criminal if you
committed a major crime.
SAM
I wish I were. Not an active criminal
but... a nice guy with the conscience
of a criminal.
(goes close to mary,
touches her)
Next best thing to no conscience at
all.
MARY
(pulling away)
I have to go, Sam.
SAM
I can come down next week.
MARY
No.
SAM
Not even just to see you, to have
lunch... in public?
MARY
We can see each other, we can even
have dinner... but respectably, in
my house with my mother's picture on
the mantel and my sister helping me
broil a big steak for three!
SAM
And after the steak... do we send
Sister to the movies and turn Mama's
picture to the wall?
MARY
Sam! No!
SAM
(after a pause, simply)
All right.
She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue
the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised
when they discover men will continue to want them even after
the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly,
places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and
simple sincerity.
SAM
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-
deductible or not, I want to see
deductible you. And under any
conditions.
(a smile)
Even respectability.
MARY
You make respectability sound...
disrespectful.
SAM
(brightly)
I'm all for it! It requires patience
and temperance and a lot of sweating-
out... otherwise, though, it's only
hard work.
(a pause)
But if I can see you, touch you even
as simply as this... I won't mind.
He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems
crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.
SAM
I'm fed up with sweating for people
who aren't there. I sweat to pay off
my father's debts... and he's in his
grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife
alimony, and she's living on the
other side of the world somewhere.
MARY
(a smile)
I pay, too. They also pay who meet
in hotel rooms.
SAM
A couple of years and the debts will
be paid off. And if she ever re-
marries, the alimony stops... and
then...
MARY
I haven't even been married once
yet!
SAM
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
MARY
(smiling, then with a
terrible urgency)
Sam, let's go get married.
SAM
And live with me in a storeroom behind
a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll
have a lot of laughs. When I send my
ex-wife her money, you can lick the
stamps.
MARY
(a deep desperation)
I'll lick the stamps.
He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly,
looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.
SAM
You know what I'd like? A clear,
empty sky... and a plane, and us in
it... and somewhere a private island
for sale, where we can run around
without our... shoes on. And the
wherewithal to buy what I'd like.
(he moves away,
suddenly serious)
Mary, you want to cut this off, go
out and find yourself someone
available.
MARY
I'm thinking of it.
SAM
(a cheerful shout)
How can you even think a thing like
that!
MARY
(picking up handbag,
starting for door)
Don't miss your plane.
SAM
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
MARY
(at door)
I'm late... and you have to put your
shoes on.
Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares
down at his shoeless feet,
CUT TO:
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE
Shooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly
to a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)
A small, moderately successful office off the main street. A
cab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay
driver, cross pavement to the office door.
INT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)
Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her
temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last
of her teens.
MARY
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
CAROLINE
(a high, bright, eager-
to-talk voice laced
to-with a vague Texan
accent)
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property,
you know, that oil lease man... so
that's why he's late.
(a pause, then, as
Mary does not respond
to the pointed thrust)
You getting a headache?
MARY
It'll pass. Headaches are like
resolutions... you forget them soon
as they stop hurting.
CAROLINE
You got aspirins? I have something...
not aspirins, but
(cheerfully takes
bottle of pills out
of desk drawer)
my mother's doctor gave these to me
the day of my wedding.
(laughs)
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers!
She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.
MARY
Were there any calls?
CAROLINE
Teddy called. Me... And my mother
called to see if Teddy called. Oh,
and your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying
and she'll be gone the whole weekend
and...
She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening.
MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the
office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a
trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-
hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful
vulgarity.
CASSIDY
Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls
should get your boss to air-condition
you up. He can afford it today.
Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead
Cassidy toward the private office.
LOWERY
Mary, will you get those copies of
the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.
Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the
desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.
CASSIDY
Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little
girl...
(laughs as Mary looks
up at him)
Not you, my daughter! A baby, and
tomorrow she stands up there and
gets her sweet self married away
from me!
(pulling out wallet)
I want you to look at my baby.
Eighteen years old... and she's never
had an unhappy day in any one of
those years!
(flashes photo)
Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some
remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore
the man's hot-breath closeness.
LOWERY
Come on, Tom, my office is air-
conditioned.
CASSIDY
(ignoring Lowery)
You know what I do with unhappiness?
I buy it off! You unhappy?
MARY
Not inordinately.
(puts deed copy into
Cassidy's too-close
hand)
CASSIDY
I'm buying this house for my baby's
wedding present. Forty thousand
dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying
happiness, that's buying off
unhappiness! That penniless punk
she's marryin'...
(laughs)
Probably a good kid... it's just
that I hate him.
(looks at deed)
Yup! Forty thousand, says here...
(to Lowery)
Casharoonie!
He takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of
new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's
nose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious
green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk.
Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the
bills, laughs wickedly.
CASSIDY
I never carry more than I can afford
to lose!
(closer to Mary)
Count 'em!
LOWERY
(shocked, worried)
Tom... cash transactions of this
size! Most irregular...
CASSIDY
So what? It's my private money!
(laughs, winks, elbows
Lowery)
And now it's yours.
CAROLINE
(staring at the money)
I declare!
CASSIDY
(whispering)
I don't! That's how I'm able to keep
it!
(laughs)
LOWERY
(hastily interrupting)
Suppose we just put this in the safe
and then Monday morning when you're
feeling good...
CASSIDY
Speakin' of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said you had in your
desk...
(laughs, as if having
given away Lowery's
secret)
Oops!
(to Mary, patting her
arm)
Usually I can keep my mouth shut!
He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks
to Mary, meaningfully.
CASSIDY
Honest. I can keep any private
transaction a secret... any pri....
(stopped by Mary's
cold gaze)
Lowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!
Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has
gone into Lower's office.
LOWERY
(quietly)
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend. Put it in the safe
deposit box, at the bank, Mary. And
we'll get him to give us a check on
Monday - instead.
He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going
to come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men
are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle,
smiles at it.
CAROLINE
He was flirting with you. I guess he
noticed my wedding ring.
Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the
other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the
filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed
copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office
door, knocks, starts to open door as:
LOWERY (O.S.)
Come in.
INT. LOWERY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - (DAY)
Mary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large
tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary
remains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk,
talking as she goes.
MARY
The copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't
mind, I'd like to go right on home
after the bank. I have a slight...
CASSIDY
You go right home! Me and your boss
are going out to get ourselves a
little drinkin' done!
(to Lowery)
Right?
LOWERY
(to Mary)
Of course. You feeling ill?
MARY
A headache.
CASSIDY
You need a week-end in Las Vegas...
playground of the world!
MARY
I'm going to spend this week-end in
bed.
(starts out)
CASSIDY
(to Lowery)
Only playground that beats Las Vegas!
Mary goes back out into the outer office, closes door.
INT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)
Mary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make
sure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down into it.
During this:
CAROLINE
Aren't you going to take the pills?
(as Mary shakes her
head)
They'll knock that headache out.
MARY
I don't need pills... just sleep.
She goes to the door.
DISSOLVE:
INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - (DAY)
A double bed in the foreground. We just see the far side as
the CAMERA SHOOTS across. Mary enters the scene, clad only
in her slip. Perhaps she is about to get into bed. Behind
her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any
contents. As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to
show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side
of the bed.
Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on
as the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed
suitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then
brings some final garments from the closet.
She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top.
Mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an
impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came.
The suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then
takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled
envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she
looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small
file-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those
brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and
policies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly,
puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her
bank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the
file-envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one
quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and
the suitcase and goes out of the room.
CUT TO:
EXT. MARY'S GARAGE - (DAY)
A two-car garage. One car is gone. Mary's car is parked in
the driveway. The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily
read the Arizona number plate in the foreground.
Mary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, intending to
put the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase
and her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car,
begins to back out of driveway.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
We are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled,
guilty face. She seems to be driving with that excess care
of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic
irregularity. She stops for a red light at a main
intersection.
FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)
We see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right
in front of Mary's car.
MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
Mary freezes.
EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
Cassidy, glancing into car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery
exclamation, elbows Lowery. Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles
pleasantly, pulls Cassidy on.
MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror
on her face.
EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
Now we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a
small confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary
intended to "spend the weekend in bed." He considers,
curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his
face.
MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
Mary sees the pause and the look.
EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
For a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to
cross back to the car.
MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
Mary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the
shrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle.
Mary zooms the car away.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY - (DAY)
Mary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is
less tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she
checks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas
station.
FAST DISSOLVE TO:
MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
Approaching and leaving city limits.
MARY - (DAY)
Looks at gas gauge.
C.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY)
EXT. A GAS STATION - (DAY)
We see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no
other cars about, this being a gas station off the main
highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary
looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face
turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.
No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as
if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that
she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty.
She has to blow her horn.
A YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.
At that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the
shack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's
car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's
insistent ringing unnerves Mary.
She starts her car, zooms off.
We see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack.
He looks after the departing car with little or no expression.
CAR
The car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is
setting. There is something vaguely ominous about the
darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing.
DISSOLVE TO:
MARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)
The oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting
sleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close,
involuntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as
if forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to
glare to a point beyond endurance. She murmurs "Sam - Sam."
LONG LAP DISSOLVE:
EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
We see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft
shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like
a child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear
that the car is empty.
After a moment, during which there are no other vehicles
passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY
PATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its
apparent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car.
He gets out and approaches the driver's side window.
EXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)
The Patrolman looks down into the car.
INT. CAR (DAWN) FROM HIS VIEWPOINT
Mary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved
by the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex,
turns the ignition and presses down on the starter.
EXT. CAR (DAWN)
The Patrolman holds up his hand.
PATROLMAN
(startled)
Hold it there!
Mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together.
The Patrolman raps again, less gently.
Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies
her for a moment.
PATROLMAN
In quite a hurry.
MARY
Yes.
(because he seems to
be awaiting an
explanation)
I didn't mean to sleep so long. I
was afraid I'd have an accident last
night, from sleepiness... so I decided
to pull over...
PATROLMAN
You slept here all night?
MARY
(a faint edge of
defensiveness)
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my
eyes...
PATROLMAN
(mere concern)
There are plenty of motels in this
area. You should have... I mean,
just to be safe...
MARY
I didn't intend to sleep all night!
I just pulled over... have I broken
any laws?
PATROLMAN
No, m'am.
MARY
Then I'm free to go...?
PATROLMAN
(a pause)
Is anything wrong?
MARY
Of course not! Am I acting as if...
something's wrong?
PATROLMAN
(almost a smile)
Frankly, yes.
MARY
Please... I'd like to go...
PATROLMAN
Is there?
MARY
Is there what?
(not waiting for an
answer)
I've told you there's nothing wrong...
except that I'm in a hurry and you're
taking up my time...
PATROLMAN
(interrupting, sternly)
Now wait just a moment! Turn your
motor off, please.
Mary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off
the ignition.
PATROLMAN
In the course of my duty, I never
"take up" anyone's time, whether
it's to give a warning, or a ticket,
or help! Believe that, M'am.
(a little softer)
Now if you woke up on the wrong side
of... the car seat, that's one thing.
But when you act as if I've just
placed you under arrest...
MARY
I'm sorry.
PATROLMAN
No need to apologize...
Mary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the
matter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone.
The Patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who
demands a thank-you, but he does feel her manner is a bit
too abrupt. He calls:
PATROLMAN
Wait a minute!
MARY
(jamming down the
brake)
Now what?
The Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:
PATROLMAN
May I see your license?
MARY
Why?
PATROLMAN
Please.
Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed
it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in
it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it.
The Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously,
pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to
remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling
her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then
the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other
items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet,
opens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at
the car.
EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks
the license plate, and returns.
INT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)
The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the
steering wheel, returns Mary's wallet.
She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment.
He says nothing. She starts ahead, fast.
EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
The Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts
back to his automobile.
MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
She is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great
deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger.
She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability
to act normally under the pressure of guilt. As she drives,
she glances into her rear-view mirror.
MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)
The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind
her at a matched speed.
MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
She glances out at her surroundings.
MARY'S POV - (DAWN)
The Freeway ahead.
EXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)
She suddenly turns off the highway.
MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
She checks her mirror.
MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)
The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off
after her.
MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick
decision.
DISSOLVE:
EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
The big sign reads "California Charlie - Automobile Paradise."
We see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out
of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention
to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on
all of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office:
CAR DEALER
With you in a second!
Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making
a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand
on the corner, just outside the lot.
She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is
fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy
herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot,
picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car
lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes,
we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same
PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite
side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in
the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see
the Patrolman.
The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting
for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.
CAR DEALER
I'm in no mood for trouble!
MARY
(glancing up, thrown
for a moment)
What?
CAR DEALER
(cheerfully)
There's an old saying, "First customer
of the day is always the most
trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no
mood for it so I'm just going to
treat you so fair and square you
won't have one human reason to give
me...
MARY
(interrupting)
Can I trade in my car and take
another?
CAR DEALER
You can do anything you've a mind
to... and bein' a woman, you will!
(chin-indicating her
car)
That yours?
MARY
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it,
I'm just...
CAR DEALER
Sick of the sight of it!
(laughs)
Well, suppose you look around for
something that strikes your eyes and
meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give
yours the once over and... want some
coffee? I was just about...
MARY
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I
just want to make a change and
start...
She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the
Patrolman.
THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate.
EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
Mary has to force herself to look away.
CAR DEALER
One thing people never ought to be
when they're buying a used car is in
a hurry!
(starting away toward
her car)
But like I said, too nice a day for
arguing. I'll just shoot this into
the garage.
He starts into Mary's car. She looks at him, in near panic,
wanting to skip the whole thing. Torn, wondering if the
presence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing
cars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be
followed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay
here.
All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing.
The Car Dealer has driven her car into the garage. She stands
in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target.
She looks toward the garage.
THE GARAGE - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
Mary's car is in it.
EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
Mary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further
suspicion, is compelled to look again at the Patrolman.
THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she
goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning.
CAR DEALER
That's the one I'd've picked for you
myself!
MARY
How much?
CAR DEALER
Go ahead! Spin it around the block.
Now I know you don't know anything
about engine condition, but you can
feel, can't you... and it's all in
the feel, believe me, you feel that
one around the block...
MARY
It looks fine. How much will it be,
with my car...?
CAR DEALER
You mean you don't want the usual
day and a half to think it over?
(laughs)
You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin'
you?
MARY
Of course not. Please.
CAR DEALER
Well... heck, this is the first time
I ever saw the customer high-pressure
the salesman!
(laughs, sees she is
in no mood for it)
I'd figure roughly...
(looks at the car,
then back at the
garage)
...your car plus five hundred.
MARY
Five hundred.
CAR DEALER
Aha! Always got time to argue money,
huh...?
MARY
All right.
As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches
into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses.
CAR DEALER
(slowly)
I take it... you can prove that car's
yours... I mean, out of state and
all... got your pink slip and your...
MARY
I think I have the necessary papers.
Is there a Ladies Room...
CAR DEALER
In the building ...
(indicates, continues
to stare quietly)
Mary starts for the building, glancing
once in the direction of the
Patrolman.
THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
He still sits, his motor throbbing, his face quiet.
EXT. THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
Mary goes into the office building.
CUT TO:
INT. LADIES ROOM - (DAY)
Mary enters, locks door, takes envelope out of her handbag,
extracts one bundle of bills from the envelope, counts off
five, puts the bundle back into the envelope and the envelope
back into the bag. Then she remembers, takes out the important
papers envelope, goes through it, finds several papers having
to do with her car, takes them all out, puts back the
envelope, starts out of the ladies Room.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
The Car Dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the
line. It stands in the clearing.
CAR DEALER
(too cheerfully)
I think you'd better give it a trial
spin. Don't want any bad word of
mouth about California Charlie.
MARY
I'd really rather not. Please. Can't
we just settle this and...
CAR DEALER
I'll be perfectly honest with you,
Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust
you, but...
MARY
(interrupting)
But what? Is there anything so
terribly wrong about... making a
decision and wanting to hurry? Do
you think I've stolen... my car?
CAR DEALER
No, M'am. I was only about to say,
I've sent my mechanic out to give
your car a little test... that's
all.
MARY
(handing him the
ownership papers and
the new bills)
I'd like to be ready when he gets
back.
CAR DEALER
Okay. If you'll come along...
He starts toward the office building. Mary follows, closely,
anxiously. She glances, sees:
THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
He is still at the far curb.
EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
The Car Dealer goes into his office. Mary follows.
THE PATROLMAN - (DAY)
A second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic,
comes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot. He
pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the
office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's
car is driven back onto the lot.
The MECHANIC stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the
Patrolman. The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he
is behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office.
In a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car,
gets in, starts the motor. The Mechanic yells:
MECHANIC
Hey! Miss?
Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic.
Her face goes white. She doesn't know which man called her.
Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase.
MARY
(as Mechanic reaches
car)
Just put it right in here, please...
beside me.
The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off.
As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer
and the Patrolman all looking after her.
DISSOLVE TO:
MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
Mary is driving tensely. She checks the rear-view mirror, is
more shocked than pleased when she sees...
MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
No sign of the Patrolman.
MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
She turns her face, looks out at the highway.
ROUTE 99 - MARY'S POV
It is heavy with traffic.
MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
Again she checks the mirror and although...
MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
There is still no sign of the Patrolman.
MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
She cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that
nothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions.
CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety,
her fears. Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a
person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this
realistic a situation. Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the
Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it
in her imagination. The "imagined voice" we hear is actually
the voice of the Car Dealer:
CAR DEALER'S VOICE
Heck, Officer, that was the first
time I ever saw the Customer high-
pressure the Salesman! Somebody
chasing her?
PATROLMAN'S VOICE
I better have a look at those papers,
Charlie.
CAR DEALER'S VOICE
She look like a wrong-one to you?
PATROLMAN'S VOICE
Acted like one.
Mary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away
these voices of her imagination. She checks the rear-view
mirror.
MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
Still no sight of the Patrolman.
MARY IN NEW CAR
She tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when
she is sprung to tension again by....
EXT. HIGHWAY
The sight of a police car. As she drives past, we hear the
squeaky, unintelligible voice coming over the car radio.
Mary zooms down on the gas, whizzes ahead.
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY 99 - LONG SHOT
Mary's car dashing along.
DISSOLVE TO:
MARY IN NEW CAR
Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving.
Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.
OUT THE WINDSHIELD
We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.
MARY IN NEW CAR
We HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an intercom system,
a sound emanating from Mary's imagination.
After the second BUZZ, we HEAR the voice of Caroline.
CAROLINE'S VOICE
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
LOWERY'S VOICE
(a worried tone)
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
CAROLINE'S VOICE
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's
always a bit late on Monday mornings.
LOWERY'S VOICE
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Again Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing
these "invented" scenes of her imagination.
EXT. HIGHWAY
Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint.
Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see
the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations
beginning to blaze on.
INT. MARY'S NEW CAR
Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices
again:
LOWERY'S VOICE
Call her sister! If no one's answering
at the house....
CAROLINE'S VOICE
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery,
where she works, the Music Makers
Music Store, you know? And she doesn't
know where Mary is any more than we
do.
LOWERY'S VOICE
You better run out to the house.
She may be... unable to answer the
phone...
CAROLINE'S VOICE
Her sister's going to do that. She's
as worried as we are.
A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face.
She closes her eyes for one tight swift moment.
EXT. HIGHWAY
We cut again to the highway. The first oncoming headlights
slash at the windshield.
INT. MARY'S NEW CAR
Cutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of
her face that she is driving faster. The oncoming headlights
blurt at her.
Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as
if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break
through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her
imagination blank.
LOWERY'S VOICE
No! I haven't the faintest idea. As
I said, I last saw your sister when
she left this office on Friday...
she said she didn't feel well and
wanted to leave early and I said she
could. And that was the last I saw...
(a pause, a thought)
...wait a minute, I did see her, an
hour or so later, driving...
(a pause, then with
solemn fear)
Ah, I think you'd better come over
here to my office. Quick.
(a pause, a click)
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.
EXT. HIGHWAY
It is completely dark now, night.
INT. MARY'S NEW CAR
We cut back to her face.
LOWERY'S VOICE
After all, Cassidy, I told you...
all that cash... I'm not taking the
responsibility... Oh, for heaven's
sake, a girl works for you for ten
years, you trust her! All right,
yes, you better come over.
FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT
EXT. THE ROAD AHEAD INT. MARY'S NEW CAR
Fast cut back to Mary's face. Oncoming headlights throw a
blinding light across her features.
CASSIDY'S VOICE
(undrunk, sharp with
rage)
Well I ain't about to kiss off forty
thousand dollars! I'll get it back
and if any of it's missin' I'll
replace it with her fine soft flesh!
I'll track her, never you doubt it!
LOWERY'S VOICE
Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't
believe... it must be some kind of a
mystery... I can't...
CASSIDY'S VOICE
You checked with the bank, no? They
never laid eyes on her, no? You
still trustin'? Hot creepers, she
sat there while I dumped it out...
hardly even looked at it, plannin'
and... and even flirtin' with me...!
A look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN
Big drops of rain begin to appear.
CLOSEUP - MARY
She is becoming aware of the rain starting.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights.
CLOSEUP - MARY
Mary starts the windshield wipers.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.
CLOSEUP - MARY
Peering through the blurred windshield.
CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS
slowing down in the flooding highway.
CLOSEUP - MARY
peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer.
CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS
almost coming to a slow turn.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
just blackness and rain.
CLOSEUP - MARY
peering.
MARY'S VIEWPOINT
An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon
sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield.
MARY'S CAR
She presses down, forces the car to move on through the
flooded road.
EXT. THE ROAD
As we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can
faintly make out the large letters which read "Motel." Mary
stops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see
the sign clearly now: "BATES MOTEL." Mary opens the car door
and dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the
motel office.
EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
Mary pauses on the porch. The lights are on within the office.
She tries door, finds it open, goes into office. CAMERA
FOLLOWS her into office. There is no one present. Mary goes
to the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response.
Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes
back out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction,
slightly behind the office, and sees...
MARY'S VIEWPOINT - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)
A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house.
There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms. A WOMAN
passes the window, pauses, peers out.
We see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from
the window.
EXT. PORCH OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get
some attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.
No one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes
out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window,
begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open
the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path.
After a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house.
Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the
porch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back
only to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to
the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his
hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached
it.
He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging
useless in his hand, then back to her.
There is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look.
Mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him
almost smile. He gestures her into the office, standing back
to indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the
office.
INT. OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
The Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN
BATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-
spoken and hesitant.
NORMAN
Dirty night.
MARY
(not really a question)
You have a vacancy?
NORMAN
(simply, almost
cheerfully)
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve
cabins, twelve vacancies.
(a pause)
They moved away the highway.
MARY
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
NORMAN
I knew you must have. No one stops
here anymore unless they do.
He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration
book.
NORMAN
But it's no good dwelling on our
losses, is it. We go right ahead
lighting signs and following the
formalities... Would you sign,
please.
Mary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the
registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with
the realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes
the name Marie Samuels.
NORMAN
Your home address. Oh, just the town
will do.
MARY
(glancing at newspaper
sticking out of her
handbag)
Los Angeles.
She realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write
it down. She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false
name. Norman smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment.
NORMAN
Cabin One. It's closer in case you
want anything... right next to the
office.
CLOSEUP - NORMAN
He removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a
remaining key on the board.
TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN
MARY
I want sleep more than anything.
Except maybe, food.
NORMAN
There's a big diner about ten miles
on up... just outside Fairvale.
MARY
Am I that close to Fairvale?
NORMAN
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
He goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down
considerably. He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate
some pleasure he finds in it. Mary follows him to the door,
goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to
her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of
Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door
of Cabin One.
Norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door,
opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches
on a light. Mary goes into the cabin. Norman follows her.
INT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)
Norman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it.
NORMAN
Stuffy in here.
(turns to her)
Well... the mattress is soft and
there're hangers in the closet and...
stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed
on it in case you want to make your
friends back home envious... and...
the... over there....
(he points to the
bathroom, fairly
blushes)
MARY
The bathroom.
NORMAN
(quickly, starting to
leave)
I'll be in the office if you want
anything... just tap on the wall.
MARY
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
NORMAN
Norman Bates.
He pauses at the door, gazes at her. She smiles.
NORMAN
You have something most girls never
have.
MARY
I have?
NORMAN
There's no name for it... But it's
something that, that puts a person
at ease.
MARY
Thank you. Again.
NORMAN
(not really a question)
You're not going to go out again and
drive up to that diner, are you?
MARY
No.
NORMAN
Then will you do me a favor?
(without waiting for
her response)
Will you have supper here? I was
just about to, myself... nothing
more than some sandwiches and a lot
of milk, but I'd like it if you'd
come up to the house and... I don't
set a fancy table but... the kitchen's
awful homey.
MARY
I'd like to.
NORMAN
All right, you get your dresses
hanging out and... change those wet
shoes, and I'll come for you soon as
it's ready...
(starts out)
...with my trusty umbrella.
(he laughs a small
laugh, runs off)
Mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to
take out a dress. Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She
glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into
the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at
it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides
to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks
about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such
places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her
bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places
the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then
places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later
reading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes
to her suitcase to start unpacking.
Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of
a woman's voice, raised in anger.
WOMAN'S VOICE
No! I tell you no!
Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible
voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA
FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is
still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming
from that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out.
WOMAN'S VOICE
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper...
(an ugly, sneering
note creeps into the
voice)
...by candlelight, I suppose, in the
cheap erotic fashion of young men
with cheap, erotic minds!
NORMAN'S VOICE
Mother, please...
WOMAN'S VOICE
And then what? After supper, music?
Whispers?
NORMAN'S VOICE
Mother, she's just a stranger...
hungry, and the weather's bad...
WOMAN'S VOICE
(mimicking cruelly)
Mother, she's just a stranger!
(hard, cruel again)
As if men don't desire strangers, as
if... oh, I refuse to speak of
disgusting things because they disgust
me! You understand, Boy?
WOMAN'S VOICE
(pause)
Go on, go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite with my
food... or my son! Or do I have to
tell her, cause you don't have the
guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts,
boy?
NORMAN'S VOICE
(blurted cut fury and
shame)
Shut up! Shut up!
There is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there.
Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress
and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes
sadly at the little empty room.
In a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door
slamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.
FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)
We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered
tray.
INT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)
Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to
the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.
EXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when
Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch,
past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He
stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her
eye.
MARY
I've caused you some trouble.
NORMAN
Mother...
(a hollow little laugh,
an attempt at sardonic
humor)
...what is the phrase... "she isn't
herself today"... I think that's it.
MARY
(looking at the tray)
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.
Norman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's
reference to Mary's appetite.
NORMAN
I'm sorry. I wish... people could
apologize for other people.
MARY
Don't worry about it.
(a warm smile)
But as long as you've made us supper,
we may as well eat it. Huh?
She begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow,
hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young
woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in
defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his
defiance for one day. He cannot go into Mary's room.
NORMAN
It might be nicer... warmer in the
office.
Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries
to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused
sympathy, then follows.
INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)
Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable
place to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing
in the doorway.
NORMAN
Eating in an office...
(a rueful smile)
...to officious, even for me. I have
the parlor behind this... if you'd
like.
Mary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and into the
darkened parlor. Mary follows.
INT. NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)
In the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office
spilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary
comes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to
lamp, turns on the light.
Mary is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one
lamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes
up at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over
the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to
the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are
of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary
stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror.
CLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN
NORMAN
Please sit down. On the sofa.
As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and
pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies
the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked
with books on the subject of "Taxidermy."
CLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY
She notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily,
and many with a vaguely religious overtone.
Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.
MARY
You're very... kind.
NORMAN
It's all for you. I'm not hungry.
Please go ahead.
Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a
small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in
the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.
Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles
and then laughs.
NORMAN
You eat like a bird.
MARY
You'd know, of course.
NORMAN
Not really. I hear that expression,
that one eats "like a bird," is really
a falsie, I mean a falsity, because
birds eat a tremendous lot.
(A pause, then
explaining)
Oh, I don't know anything about birds.
My hobby is stuffing things...
taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because... well, I hate
the look of beasts when they're
stuffed, foxes and chimps and all...
some people even stuff dogs and
cats... but I can't... I think only
birds look well stuffed because
they're rather... passive, to begin
with... most of them...
He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return
of his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him,
with some compression, smiles.
MARY
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I
mean.
NORMAN
Uncommon, too.
MARY
I imagine so.
NORMAN
It's not as expensive as you'd think.
Cheap, really. Needles, thread,
sawdust .. the chemicals are all
that cost anything.
(He goes quiet, looks
disturbed)
MARY
A man should have a hobby.
NORMAN
It's more than a hobby... sometimes...
a hobby is supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.
MARY
(after a pause, softly)
Is your time so empty?
NORMAN
Oh, no!
(forcing brightness
again)
I run the office, tend the cabins
and grounds, do little chores for
mother... the ones she allows I might
be capable of doing.
MARY
You go out... with friends?
NORMAN
Friends? Who needs friends.
(Laughs, then with
gallows humor)
A boy's best friend is his mother.
(Stops laughing)
You've never had an empty moment in
your whole life. Have you?
MARY
Only my share.
NORMAN
Where are you going? I don't mean to
pry...
MARY
(A wistful smile)
I'm looking for a private island.
NORMAN
What are you running away from?
MARY
(Alert)
Why do you ask that?
NORMAN
No. People never run away from
anything.
(A pause)
The rain didn't last very long.
(Turning suddenly)
You know what I think? I think we're
all in our private traps, clamped in
them, and none of us can ever climb
out. We scratch and claw... but only
at the air, only at each other, and
for all of it, we never budge an
inch.
MARY
Sometimes we deliberately step into
those traps.
NORMAN
I was born in mine. I don't mind it
anymore.
MARY
You should... mind it.
NORMAN
Oh I do... but I say I don't.
(Laughs boyishly)
MARY
(Staring at him,
shaking her head
softly.)
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way
I heard... The way she spoke to you,
I don't think I could ever laugh
again.
NORMAN
(Controlled resentment)
Sometimes when she talks that way to
me I'd like to... curse her out and
leave her forever!
(A rueful smile)
Or at least, defy her.
(A pause, a hopeless
shrug)
But I couldn't. She's ill.
MARY
She sounded strong...
NORMAN
I mean... ill.
(A pause)
She had to raise me all by herself
after my dad died... I was only
five... and it must have been a
strain. Oh, she didn't have to go
out to work or anything, Dad left us
with a little something... anyway, a
few years ago... Mother met a man.
He talked her into building this
motel... We could have talked her
into anything... and when. Well...
It was just too much for her when he
died, too... And the way he died...
Oh, it's nothing to talk about when
you're eating.
(Pauses, smiles)
Anyway, it was too much of a loss
for my mother... she had nothing
left.
MARY
(Critically)
Except you.
NORMAN
A son is a poor substitute for a
lover.
(Turns away as if in
distaste of the word)
MARY
Why don't you go away?
NORMAN
To a private island, like you?
MARY
No, not like me.
NORMAN
It's too late for me. And besides...
who'd look after her? She'd be alone
up there, the fire would go out...
damp and cold, like a grave. When
you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them. Oh,
I don't hate her. I hate... what
she's become. I hate... the illness.
MARY
(Slowly, carefully)
Wouldn't it be better if you put her
in... someplace...
She hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a
striking coldness.
NORMAN
An Institution? A madhouse? People
always call a madhouse "someplace."
(Mimicing coldly)
Put her in Someplace!
MARY
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to
sound uncaring...
NORMAN
(The coldness turning
to tight fury)
What do you mean about caring? Have
you ever seen one of those places?
Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel
eyes studying you... and my mother
there? Why? has she harmed you?
She's as harmless as... one of these
stuffed birds.
MARY
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed
she was harming you. I meant...
NORMAN
(High fury now)
Well? You meant well? People always
mean well, they cluck their thick
tongues and shake their heads and
suggest so very delicately that...
The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks
back into his chair. There is a brief silence.
Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained
by his anguish.
NORMAN
(Quietly)
I've suggested it myself. But I hate
to even think such a thing. She
needs me... and it isn't...
(Looks up with a
childlike pleading
in his eyes)
...it isn't as if she were a maniac,
a raving thing... it's just that...
sometimes she goes a little mad. We
all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't
you?
MARY
(After a long
thoughtful pause)
Yes, and just one time can be enough.
(Rises)
Thank you.
NORMAN
(Cheerfully, correcting)
Thank you, Norman.
MARY
Norman.
NORMAN
You're not going to... to your room
already?
MARY
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long
drive tomorrow. All the way back to
Phoenix.
NORMAN
Phoenix?
MARY
I stepped into a private trap back
there -- and I want to go back and...
try to pull myself out.
(Looking close at
Norman)
Before it's too late for me, too.
NORMAN
(Looking at her)
Why don't you stay a little while,
just for talking.
MARY
I'd like to, but...
NORMAN
Alright. I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you breakfast. What time
will you...
MARY
Very early. Dawn.
NORMAN
Alright, Miss...
(He has forgotten her
name)
MARY
Crane.
NORMAN
That's it.
(He frowns, as if
bothered by not being
able to match the
name to the memory
of the name in the
registration book)
MARY
Good night.
She goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's
viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into
the night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see
his face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of
determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts
to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of
Mary's door in the cabin next door.
He holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks
at the book.
C.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS"
M.S. - NORMAN
He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression.
The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft
SOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet. Norman turns
his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting
an impulse to listen, or more than listen.
But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and,
resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of
his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too
had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a
picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning
against. Slowly he starts toward it.
He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame
off the wall.
A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the
hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is
very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light
striking Norman's face.
We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile
fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See
the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps
through.
NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary
undressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over
a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to
unhook her bra.
NORMAN - ECU
He watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up
and down the unseen figure of Mary.
NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
Mary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.
NORMAN
He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues
turning until he can look out the small parlor window.
We see, as he sees...
THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND
NORMAN
He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we
see anger and anguish. And then resolve.
Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in
the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go
through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering
to close the door behind him.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)
Norman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big
house. Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in
the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his
shoulders, strides manfully up the path.
CAMERA follows behind him. He opens the door of the house,
enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look
up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He
holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage
evaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-
passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen.
At the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops
wearily into a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg
and gently pushes the kitchen door closed.
CUT TO:
INT. MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)
Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a
small notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which
indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money
she has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her
bankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly
beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after
subtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which
matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.
Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after
subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not
wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure
that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to
continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the
page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into
small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces
into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her
robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.
INT. MARY IN SHOWER
Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see
the bathroom door, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch
Mary as she washes and soaps herself.
There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she
looks somewhat relieved.
Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.
The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is
then slowly and carefully closed.
And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower
curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white
brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.
Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain,
rip it aside.
CUT TO:
MARY - ECU
As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower
curtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in
her face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her
throat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous
bread knife. The flint of the blade shatters the screen to
an almost total, silver blankness.
THE SLASHING
An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very
screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of
screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as
Mary's body falls in the tub.
REVERSE ANGLE
The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand
pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a
glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with
madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a
fright-wig. And then we see only the curtain, closed across
the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the
shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a
moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.
CUT TO:
THE DEAD BODY
Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over,
touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if
popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.
Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along
the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA
FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the
bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA
approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed
it on the bedside table.
CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER
beside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window
and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR,
coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful,
shocked voice.
NORMAN'S VOICE
Mother! Oh God, what... blood,
blood... mother...!
We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.
After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the
front door, dashes down the path toward the motel.
QUICK CUT TO:
EXT. THE PATH - (NIGHT)
Norman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes into
an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in
his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman
runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's
room.
INT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)
Norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the
room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open.
He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.
Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face,
covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the
window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we
see the bedside table with the newspaper on it.
After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the
edge of the bed.
FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN
Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can
see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile
floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of
his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the
peace that comes with decision.
Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with
resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across
it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch,
and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the
bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from
the bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out.
EXT. THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
Norman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully
behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We
stay outside. Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and
then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the
office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door
opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman
comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about,
goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into
Mary's cabin, closing the door after him.
INT. MARY'S CABIN
With the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see
him in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then
gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him
set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower
being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES
FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom.
CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up.
Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges
with it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him
spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside
the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of
it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over
and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and
CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman.
He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his
body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it
across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain
in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up,
examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to
the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.
CLOSE SHOT
We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being
diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.
NORMAN
We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn
to the job of cleaning the bathroom.
He places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the
mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the
wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and
even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel
and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.
Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail,
cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom.
INT. MARY'S BEDROOM
Norman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to
the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of
her car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk,
where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up
the keys, crosses the room, goes out.
EXT. THE PORCH
We see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then
hurry across the porch and into Mary's car. He circle-turns
the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch,
directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.
Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key
and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin.
INT. MARY'S ROOM
From a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to
wrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of
the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he
picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his
foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind
him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body
in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it.
He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely,
flicks on the light.
Again the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he
pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he
is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues
with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to
gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase.
He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks
under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that
room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about
carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the
suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl
are gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks
it up.
With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the
mop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches
off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts
out.
EXT. THE PORCH
As Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly
lit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of
the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a
flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman
to regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the
car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and
the pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then
realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin.
He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the
newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the
newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom. His glance
goes right over the toilet bowl.
He turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes
out onto the porch.
He reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it.
He goes around and jumps into the car and starts away.
We HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)
The car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as
CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.
It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects.
Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns
off the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the
swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car,
realizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases
the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car
begins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW,
THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.
The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane
flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps
away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the
plane overhead grows louder.
Norman looks up.
NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY
We see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to
diminish.
CUT BACK TO:
NORMAN
We see the relief in his face. He looks at the car.
More than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp.
The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime,
as if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to
panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And
slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear
only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only
the small after-bubble, like a visual burp.
Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire
marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.
He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE UP NORMAN
standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post.
He is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual
innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment
of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down
and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground
outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the
tire marks.
After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose,
places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see
that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the
road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a
car had been parked here.
After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it
off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away
from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that
leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps
of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up
the steps and into the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES
as he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the
stairs.
On the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is
closed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained
dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an EXTREMELY
HIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up
the stained dress and shoes.
He rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat
bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading
for the basement.
EXT. A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)
It stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait.
Then, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN
INT. BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)
Sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence
begins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can
read as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead
reads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest
right-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room
which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks
big enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped
and miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come
to your senses, and still want to...
CAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper
over, continues backing away out of the small back room and
heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk,
BOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter,
a look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a
meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and
examining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES:
WOMAN CUSTOMER
...They tell you what its ingredients
are and how it's guaranteed to
exterminate any insect in the world,
but they do not tell you whether or
not it's painless. And I say insect
or man, death should always be
painless.
CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware
store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door.
She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a
look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small
overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE.
Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her,
gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod.
Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her
eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:
LILA
Sam?
SUMMERFIELD
You want to see Sam?
LILA
Sam Loomis.
SUMMERFIELD
(yelling toward back
room)
Sam! Lady wants to see you!
Lila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on
worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can.
Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a
moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he
does not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried
expression.
SAM
Yes?
LILA
May I talk to you?
SAM
(a bit mystified)
Sure...
Lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts
toward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then
follows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him
intently as she says:
LILA
I'm Mary's sister.
SAM
Lila.
LILA
(quickly)
Is Mary here?
Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile
expression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment.
Behind them is a display of various size carving knives.
SAM
Is something wrong?
LILA
I want to know if my sister is here.
SAM
Here?
LILA
With you.
SAM
Where?
LILA
I don't know where. In your store,
somewhere in your town... anywhere.
SAM
What's the matter?
LILA
Don't you know?
As Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing
past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.
WOMAN CUSTOMER
All I can do is hope if it isn't
painless, it's quick!
She speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods
happily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring
apprehensively at Lila.
SAM
What should I know?
LILA
To begin with, where Mary is. Do
you?
SAM
No. I take it you don't either?
(As Lila shakes her
head)
How long?
LILA
Last Friday. She left work, and
home... I was in Tucson over the
weekend... I haven't heard from her,
not even a phone call.
SAM
And you thought she'd come up here,
to me? If she had, what reason would
she have for not calling you?
LILA
A good reason, I suppose.
SAM
(Slightly exasperated)
Well what do you think, we eloped or
something? Or we're living in sin
and...
LILA
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being
defensive that you haven't even
reacted to the most serious fact of
all. Mary is missing.
SAM
I was getting to that!
LILA
What do you know about it?
SAM
Nothing! You're putting me on the
defensive.
LILA
Look, if you two are in this thing
together, I don't care, it's none of
my business... But I want to see
Mary. I want her to tell me she's
all right and it's none of my
business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix
and...
She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes
beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a
moment, then turns and calls:
SAM
Bob? Run out and get yourself some
lunch.
SUMMERFIELD
It's okay, Sam, I brought it with
me.
SAM
Run out and eat it.
Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way.
Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness.
SAM
What thing?
LILA
Huh?
SAM
What thing could we be in together?
LILA
(A pause)
I hate tears.
(Takes out hankie)
SAM
Is Mary... in trouble?
LILA
Yes.
SAM
Well why didn't she come to me...
call me...?
LILA
Not that kind...
(Almost a smile)
You men and your egos.
SAM
(Seriously)
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about
Mary.
Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled
quietly into the room. He ignores them, walks past them,
goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "CLOSED
FOR LUNCH," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the
sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam
and Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly
smile.
ARBOGAST
Let's all talk about Mary.
SAM
Who are you, friend?
ARBOGAST
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.
(To Lila)
Where is she, Miss Crane?
LILA
I don't know.
ARBOGAST
Wouldn't have been able to tail you
if you did.
SAM
What's your interest?
ARBOGAST
Money.
There is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the
sudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes.
SAM
Somebody better tell me what's going
on and tell me fast! I can take so
much and then...
ARBOGAST
(Interrupting calmly)
Your girl friend stole forty thousand
dollars.
Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks
one of those seemingly ridiculous questions.
SAM
Why?
ARBOGAST
(An almost amused
smile)
Must've needed it.
SAM
What are you talking about?
(To Lila)
What is this?
LILA
She was supposed to bank it, on
Friday, for her boss. She didn't.
And no one has seen her since.
ARBOGAST
(Looking at Sam)
Someone has seen her. Someone always
sees a girl with forty thousand
dollars.
(To Sam)
She is your girl friend, isn't she?
LILA
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back. It
was all in cash...
ARBOGAST
(Correcting with
Cassidy's word)
Casharoonie!
LILA
Sam, if she's here...
SAM
She isn't!
A real look of anguish comes into Lila's face. And Arbogast
studies it, then speaks.
ARBOGAST
You came up here on a hunch, Miss
Crane? Nothing more? No phone call...
from him, or from your sister herself?
LILA
(wearily)
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
ARBOGAST
With a little checking, I could get
to believe you.
LILA
(anxiously)
I don't care if you do or... I want
to see Mary... before she gets in
any deeper...
SAM
Did you check in Phoenix...
hospitals... maybe she had an
accident... a hold-up...
ARBOGAST
She was seen leaving town in her
car. Seen by her very victims, I
might add.
SAM
(after a moment)
I don't believe it.
(to Lila, slowly)
Do you?
LILA
(a thoughtful pause)
Yes... I just... did. The moment
they told me...
SAM
You might have doubted for say five
minutes or so, Sister.
Lila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face.
Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.
ARBOGAST
We're always quickest to doubt people
who have a record for being honest.
I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where
there's a boyfriend...
(Trails off, smiles
encouragingly)
She won't be back there among the
nuts and bolts... but she'll be in
this town... somewhere. I'll find
her.
He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to
the counter, opens door, goes out into the street.
After a quiet moment:
LILA
I just listened... and believed
everything they told me. 'She stole
the money.' 'We don't want to get
her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the
police in'...
SAM
It was her boss' idea not to report
it to the police?
LILA
No. The man whose money she... he
talked so loud and fast, and I... I
should've called the police.
SAM
He must have had a darn good reason
for wanting them kept out of it...
All that cash...
LILA
I ought to call the police right
now!
SAM
No.
LILA
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here?
Are you two planning to go away with
the money?
SAM
How could I go away? I'm in debt up
to my...
(Smiles at the
incongruity of his
reply, then goes
serious)
If she did steal that money... It's
hard to believe she did because it's
hard to see why she would. Unless
she had some wild idea that it would
help me... us...
LILA
She haven't even called you?
SAM
I didn't see her... and I didn't
hear from her! Believe that!
LILA
I need to... I need to believe
something. This is the first time
I've ever come up against anything I
couldn't... understand.
SAM
You've led a charmed life.
LILA
No. I just think... anything can be
explained. But Mary, doing a thing
like this... I don't know how to
handle...
SAM
Maybe we can handle it together.
(He smiles
encouragingly)
LILA
(A rueful shrug)
I came flying up here expecting to
get some explanation... for all I
know, she may be trying to get in
touch with me, at home. I'd better
go home.
SAM
(A thoughtful pause)
I think she'll contact me if she
contacts anybody. Why don't you stay
here. When she shows up... or calls...
be here.
LILA
(A long study, her
suspicion of him
evaporating)
You want me to stay here?
SAM
She'll need both of us.
LILA
(considers, then:)
Where... can I stay?
SAM
(brightly)
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the
street. Come on.
(as he reaches for
the closed-for-lunch
sign)
After we check you in we'll go to
the drugstore and get you a sandwich.
Then we'll come back here... and
wait.
He hangs the sign on the door, ushers Lila out, closes door
behind him.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - (DAY)
They emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel. As
they enter, Arbogast is in the act of taking over a white
Ford sedan from a rental car man. They glance at him and he
returns a cynical look.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HOTEL - (DAY)
Outside another hotel we see Arbogast alight from the white
car and go into new hotel.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - (DAY)
The white car speeding along the highway.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NEW MOTEL - (DAY)
Arbogast going into the office - we see the sign above him.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)
A high shot showing the freeway and Bates house and motel on
the side old highway. A pause and then across the bottom of
the picture a white car speeds by on the freeway.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HOTEL - (DUSK)
Another Hotel. Arbogast goes in.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)
The white car speeding along the freeway again going in the
opposite direction to last time. Norman, a tiny figure, is
seen going up the steps to his mother's house.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - (DAY)
Arbogast's search is getting down in the scale. This is an
entrance to a cheesy boarding house. "Rooms to Rent," etc.
He looks at his list and then goes in.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)
The white car goes by on the freeway again.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - (DAY)
Arbogast goes in.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)
Heavy traffic on the freeway. A beat or two - again the white
car. It slows up opposite the distant motel. It makes a turn
and goes back out of scene. A pause and it reappears on the
old road and slowly makes its way toward the Bates' Motel.
EXT. THE BATES' HOUSE AND MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)
We now see Norman. He has brought out an old rocking chair
and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched
in it. And he is darning one of his own socks. CAMERA HOLDS.
Beyond the porch, and Norman, we see the old house and can
barely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his
mother seated at the window. Here, too, there is that quality
of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding.
Now Norman looks up at the SOUND of the approaching car.
And continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast
gets out. Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over, gazes
at Norman, starts forward. In his steps and manner there is
that bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too
many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers
over too short a period of time.
Norman rises as Arbogast comes forward.
NORMAN
(shoving sock in his
pocket)
I always forget to put the sign on,
but we do have vacancy.
(Cheerfully)
Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve
vacancies.
ARBOGAST
(pleasantly)
In the past two days I've been to so
many motels, my eyes are bleary with
neon. This is the first one that
looked like it was hiding from the
world at large.
NORMAN
I don't really forget the sign, it
just doesn't seem... any use.
(Points)
This used to be the main highway.
(Starts for office)
Want to register, please?
ARBOGAST
Sit down. I don't want to trouble
you, just want to ask...
NORMAN
No trouble. Today's linen day. I
change all the beds once a week,
whether they've been used or not...
dampness. I hate the smell of
dampness.
(Opening office door)
It's such a dank smell.
Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in.
Norman follows.
INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (TWILIGHT)
Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen
closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has
remained standing by the door.
NORMAN
You out to buy a motel?
ARBOGAST
No.
NORMAN
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been
to so many in two days... What was
it you wanted to ask?
ARBOGAST
I'm looking for a missing person.
(takes out and opens
wallet and extends
it as he speaks)
My name's Arbogast, private
investigator...
(takes back wallet
when Norman doesn't
look at it)
Trying to trace a young girl who's
been missing almost a week. From
Phoenix.
(A look at Norman's
frightened expression)
It's a private matter... family wants
to forgive her...
(smiles)
She isn't in trouble.
NORMAN
(forcing a smile)
I didn't think the police went
searching for people who weren't in
trouble.
ARBOGAST
I'm not the police.
NORMAN
Oh.
He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out
sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast.
Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he
crosses to Norman.
ARBOGAST
We have reason to believe she came
this way... might have stopped in
this area...
(extends photograph,
which Norman doesn't
glance at)
Did she stop here?
NORMAN
No. No one has stopped here in
weeks...
ARBOGAST
Mind looking at the picture before
committing yourself?
NORMAN
Committing myself to what? You sure
talk like a Policeman.
ARBOGAST
Look at the picture. Please.
Norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow
cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively.
NORMAN
No. At least I don't recall.
ARBOGAST
She might have used an alias. Mary
Crane's the real name, but she
might've registered...
NORMAN
(interrupting)
I don't even bother with guests
registering any more... I mean, little
by little, you drop the formalities.
(more relaxed, because
Arbogast is listening
with a pleasant smile)
I shouldn't even bother to change
the linen. I guess habits die hard.
Which reminds me...
He goes to the wall, flips a light switch.
NORMAN
The vacancy sign. Just in case.
We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't
been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining
town or something.
ARBOGAST
Now there's a couple even remarking
about your sign, and see how easily
you forgot them?
NORMAN
What?
ARBOGAST
You thought no one has stopped here
in weeks. Now, try to remember if
this girl...
ARBOGAST
(A pause, a study)
Maybe she even signed the register...
because habits die hard. Let's check
it, huh?
Norman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the
registry book around, flips back a page or two.
Norman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faintly,
pleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then:
ARBOGAST
Yes sir! Marie Samuels. Interesting
alias.
He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside
the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding
and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as
happy as it is making him.
ARBOGAST
Don't know where she got "Marie,"
but "Samuels" figures. Her boy
friend's name is Sam.
(Turns to Norman, the
smile gone)
Was she in disguise? Or do you want
to check the picture again?
NORMAN
I didn't lie to you. I just have
trouble keeping track of... time.
Arbogast has reached him, the picture extended. Norman looks
dutifully at it.
NORMAN
It was raining and her hair didn't
look like that... damped out, I guess.
ARBOGAST
Tell me all about her.
NORMAN
She arrived kind of late, wet and
hungry and she was very tired and
went right to bed and left early.
ARBOGAST
How early?
NORMAN
Very early. Dawn.
ARBOGAST
Of which morning?
NORMAN
The following morning. Sunday.
ARBOGAST
No one met her?
NORMAN
No.
ARBOGAST
Or arrived with her.
NORMAN
No.
ARBOGAST
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
NORMAN
No.
ARBOGAST
You didn't spend the whole night
with her did you?
NORMAN
No! Of all...
ARBOGAST
How do you know she didn't make a
call?
NORMAN
She was tired. She said she had a
long drive ahead of her, in the
morning... Yes, now I'm remembering
very clearly because I'm picturing.
When you make a picture of the moment
in your mind, you can remember every
detail. She was sitting back there,
no she was standing up, with some
sandwich still in her hand, and she
said she had to drive a long way.
ARBOGAST
Back where?
NORMAN
What do you mean?
ARBOGAST
You said she was sitting "back there,"
or standing rather...
NORMAN
Oh. My private parlor. She had an
awful hunger... so I made her some
supper. And then she went to bed and
left in the morning. I didn't even
see her leave.
ARBOGAST
How did she pay you?
NORMAN
What?
ARBOGAST
Cash or check? For the cabin...
NORMAN
Cash.
ARBOGAST
And when she left, she never came
back.
NORMAN
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have
work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
ARBOGAST
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't
aspic!
(smiles)
This ain't jelling.
NORMAN
I don't know what you expect me to
know about... people come and go...
ARBOGAST
She isn't still here, is she?
NORMAN
Not at all!
ARBOGAST
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins,
all twelve... would I need a warrant?
NORMAN
(as if pleasantly
exasperated)
Look, if you won't believe me, go
ahead. You can help me make beds if
you like.
(laughs, shakes his
head)
Come on.
He starts out. Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the
young man's openness.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
Norman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One,
walks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if
Arbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch,
but is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of
the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old
house. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the
Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene.
NORMAN
Change your mind?
Arbogast does not reply. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts
to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful.
NORMAN
I guess I've got one of those faces
you can't help believing.
ARBOGAST
(to Norman, but
continuing to stare
at the house)
Anyone at home?
NORMAN
I live there. Alone.
ARBOGAST
Someone is sitting in that window.
NORMAN
My mother.
Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him.
NORMAN
She's... ill. Confined to her room.
It's practically living alone.
ARBOGAST
(after a pause)
If this girl Mary Crane were here,
you'd have no reason to hide her
would you?
NORMAN
Of course not.
ARBOGAST
If she paid you well?
NORMAN
Now, look...!
ARBOGAST
Or if she had you say... gallantly
protecting her... you wouldn't be
fooled... you'd know she was just
using you. Wouldn't you?
NORMAN
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable
of being fooled! Not even by women!
ARBOGAST
I didn't mean that as a slur on your
manhood. I'm sorry.
NORMAN
(disturbed now)
That's all right. maybe she could
have fooled me. But...
(a rueful smile)
She didn't fool my mother.
ARBOGAST
Your mother met her?
(quickly)
Can I talk to your mother?
NORMAN
No. I told you, she's confined...
ARBOGAST
Just for a moment. She might have
picked up a hint you'd miss.
ARBOGAST
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I
won't disturb...
NORMAN
No! Just no! I have one of those
breaking points like any other man,
believe it or not, and I'm near it.
There's just so much pushing I can
take and I think...
ARBOGAST
All right!
(starts away, toward
his car, pauses)
Might save me a lot of leg-work if I
could just talk to your mother. But
I'd need a warrant for that, won't
I?
Norman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts
the motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own
face showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around
very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the
lighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his
headlights light up the porch.
Norman stands, watching him drive away.
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)
The car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor
running. As he starts to walk across the highway, CAMERA
PULLS AWAY and we
CUT TO:
EXT. HIGHWAY WITH TELEPHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)
Arbogast gets to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS
FORWARD, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from
his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and
dial this number. As we reach phone booth,
CUT TO:
ARBOGAST
(into phone)
Miss Crane, please.
(listens)
She leave a number?
(listens)
Thanks.
(hangs up, dials again,
waits)
Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast.
(waits)
Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it
might make you feel a little better.
Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday
night at Bates' Motel, out here on
the old highway.
(listens)
Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent
the night, left, period!
(listens)
I did question him, believe me. I
think I got all there was to get.
Just have to try to pick up the scent
from here.
(listens)
Well... maybe that's because I don't
feel entirely satisfied. He's got a
sick old mother, confined type, and
I think she saw Mary and talked to
her. Shame, too... confined old women
love to talk to strangers.
(listens)
I was, but I think I'll go back to
the motel, first.
(listens)
No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis.
I should be back in an hour.
(listens)
All right. And Lila... You'll be
happy to know what I think. I think
our friend Sam Loomis didn't even
know Mary was here.
(smiles)
See you in an hour. Or less.
He hangs up, gets out of the phone booth.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
A distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on
in the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office.
We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch
toward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He
goes into the last cabin and switches the light on. Into the
foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and
stops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office.
EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)
Arbogast goes in.
INT. OFFICE - (NIGHT)
Arbogast looks around the empty office and calls.
ARBOGAST
Bates!
He goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks
around the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees:
C.U. - THE OLD SAFE IN THE CORNER
C.U. - ARBOGAST
goes over to it. He finds it unlocked. With a quick, cautious
look around he opens it.
C.U. - THE EMPTY SAFE
C.U. - ARBOGAST
straightens up and goes out.
EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)
Arbogast comes out and looks off. He sees:
THE LAST LIT CABIN
The door ajar.
C.U. - ARBOGAST - (NIGHT)
would go along but he stops with a new thought. He turns
around and looks off.
L.S. - THE OLD HOUSE FROM HIS VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)
C.U. - ARBOGAST
comes to a decision. He goes off.
L.S. ARBOGAST
dashes up the stone steps to the House.
MEDIUM SHOT
CAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house
is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill
of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs
hall. Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in,
sees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for
along moment, hears nothing.
Very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door
and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. The door begins
to open. He allows it to open just enough for him to slip
through and into the foyer.
CUT TO:
INT. FOYER OF BATES' HOUSE - (NIGHT)
Arbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it,
waiting. He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no
one. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast
listens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds
coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the
sounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait,
he crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly,
placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks
or groans before placing his full weight on it. CAMERA
FOLLOWS, remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the
stairway as Arbogast makes his way up.
CUT TO:
EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE
INT. STAIRWAY AND UPSTAIRS LANDING
We see Arbogast coming up the stairs. And now we see, too,
the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly.
As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother
steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous
knife flashing.
C.U. - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST
The knife slashes across his cheek and neck. Blood spurts.
The sudden attack throws him off balance. He stumbles back
and staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically
gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the
stairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife
keeps thrusting itself into the foreground. As he collapses
at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates
plunges into the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain
the raising and descending murder weapon.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
INT. BACK ROOM OF HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)
Lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't
moved from it in the last hour. Sam is pacing, occasionally
stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again. The ash
tray close to Lila is filled.
There is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness
in the small, otherwise cozy room.
SAM
(at window, quietly)
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice, Lila?
LILA
(unable to keep up
small talk)
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
SAM
It's been three.
LILA
Are we just going to go on sitting
here?
SAM
(suddenly cheerful)
He'll be back. Let's sit still and
hang on, okay?
LILA
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
SAM
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
LILA
Whenever I start contemplating the
panic button, your back straightens
up and your eyes get that God-looks-
out-for-everybody look and... I feel
better.
SAM
I feel better when you feel better.
LILA
(a pause - then she
rises)
Where's the old highway?
SAM
You want to run out there, bust in
on Arbogast and the sick old lady,
shake her up and maybe spoil
everything Arbogast's been building
for the last three hours.
LILA
Yes.
SAM
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
LILA
Patience doesn't run in our family.
Sam, I'm going out there!
SAM
Arbogast said...
LILA
An hour! Or less!
Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real
anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator.
SAM
(into phone)
Got the number of the motel out on
the old highway? Bates, I think.
(waits)
LILA
Sam! Why call when we can go?
SAM
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?
(into phone)
Thanks.
He presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates'
Motel. The faint other-end ringing tones can be heard,
repeatedly, annoyingly. He waits.
SAM
(to Lila)
Probably on his way back right now.
LILA
Sam, I'm going.
SAM
(hangs up and picks
up his jacket)
You'll never find it.
He starts for the door. Lila follows after him into the store.
INT. STORE
He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms.
SAM
Stay here.
LILA
Why can't I go out there with you?
SAM
(looks at her)
I don't know...
(he collects himself)
One of us has to be here in case
Arbogast's on the way.
LILA
(nervously)
Just wait here?
SAM
(a warm smile)
Contemplate your... panic button.
He hurries down to the street door and out. CAMERA HOLDS on
Lila as she stares after Sam. As she stands alone in the
darkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister
shapes.
C.U.
Among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls
onto the floor.
MEDIUM SHOT
Lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in
its place. She turns and again looks to the deserted street
with a touch of anxiety. She gives a slight unconscious
shiver.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)
Tall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of
Norman, silhouetted. He doesn't move, merely stands there at
the edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet
face of it.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)
All light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's
room. And her figure can be seen sitting in the window,
relaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned into the room.
After a second, we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR, and then Sam's
small pick-up truck swings into the driveway.
Sam stops the motor, automatically switches off headlights,
pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area.
Then he hops out of the cab, goes quickly to the office,
knocks on the door. As he waits for a response, he looks
down the long porch, studies the darkened cabins, knocks
again, louder, looks in the other direction and sees the
house and the figure at the one lit window. He stares a moment
then calls loudly:
SAM
Arbogast?
CUT TO:
EXT. THE SWAMP
The silhouette of Norman. He is still. Over shot, very dimly,
comes the SOUND OF SAM'S VOICE, calling again for Arbogast.
Norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile,
his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in
the direction of the house. There is silence for a moment,
and then again the SOUND of Sam POUNDING at the door.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)
The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room
spilling in.
L.S.
With CAMERA placed with its back to the street door, we can
see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in
the back room beyond. There is a SOUND of a car pulling up.
The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back
room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a BIG HEAD.
We see Lila's desperate anxious look.
MEDIUM SHOT
From her viewpoint we see Sam alighting from his truck and
coming toward the door of the store. He enters. He and Lila
exchange quiet glances.
SAM
He didn't come back here?
LILA
(worriedly)
Sam.
SAM
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the
old lady at home...
(frowning)
A sick old lady unable to answer the
door... or unwilling.
LILA
Where could he have gone?
SAM
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on...
LILA
Without calling me?
SAM
In a hurry.
LILA
Sam, he called me when he had nothing
definite, nothing but a dissatisfied
feeling. Don't you think he'd have
called if he had anything...
SAM
(interrupting)
Yes. I think he would have.
Lila goes quiet. Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at
the doorway, turns. Lila has remained by the door, looking
out at the street. She feels his pause, turns, and for a
moment they share at each other across the darkened room.
SAM
Let's go see Al Chambers.
LILA
Who's he?
SAM
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
As he starts forward.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. STREET THE SHERIFF LIVES ON - (NIGHT)
A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses
dim in the moonlight. Sam's pick-up truck comes down the
street, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers. CAMERA
MOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the
truck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.
SAM
Our Deputy sleeps.
LILA
Well?
SAM
Nothing. Just... all the lights
out... must be asleep.
LILA
(a small exasperation)
Does that mean we can't...
SAM
No. I'm just procrastinating. People
hate when the doorbell rings in the
middle of the night.
(gives up, starts out)
Come on.
He gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila. She is already
out. CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door.
Sam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost
knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST
OF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like
a fire alarm than a doorbell.
He tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The
downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is
unhesitatingly opened by MRS. CHAMBERS, a small, lively stick
of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of
hospitality.
MRS. CHAMBERS
Oh?
SAM
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering
you...
MRS. CHAMBERS
You didn't!
(a cross look up at
the bell)
It's tinkerbell.
(a quick smile at
Lila)
Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if
anyone rings it in the middle of the
night.
(to Sam)
Well come on in, at least!
As she opens the door wide,
CUT TO:
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL OF SHERIFF'S HOUSE - (NIGHT)
Fat roses splatter the wallpaper. The stairs are carpeted.
The lighting is bright.
There is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch.
Mrs. Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up.
MRS. CHAMBERS
Albert!
(a tiny wait, a smile
as Sam and Lila enter)
Al Chambers!
Sam is about to close the door behind him. Mrs. Chambers
motions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans
outside, presses the doorbell. The RING within the house is
even more shattering. She closes the door, starts to the
stairway, pauses as the SOUNDS of movement above COME OVER
SHOT.
MRS. CHAMBERS
Customers!
SHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which
matches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face
originally destined for Mount Rushmore. He nods at Sam, looks
at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern.
SAM
We have a problem.
MRS. CHAMBERS
(to Lila)
Let's go out back and have some coca
while the men are talking.
LILA
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
SAM
I don't know where to start...
(a look at Lila)
Except at the beginning.
LILA
Yes.
SAM
(to Sheriff)
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix.
She's been here for a few days,
looking for her sister. There's a
private detective helping... and,
well, we got a call tonight, from
this detective, saying he'd traced
Mary...
MRS. CHAMBERS
Mary is Lila's sister?
SAM
Yes. He traced her to that motel,
out on the old highway...
MRS. CHAMBERS
(to the Sheriff)
Bates' Motel.
(to Lila)
He has a mind like a mechanical brain
and the more information you feed
it... Go on, Sam.
SAM
He traced her there and called us to
say he was going to question Mrs.
Bates...
MRS. CHAMBERS
(a pleasant shock)
Norman took a wife?
SAM
No. An old woman, his mother.
(to Sheriff, quickly)
That was early this evening. And we
haven't seen or heard from him since.
I went out to the motel, just got
back. No one was in the office, and...
LILA
(interrupting,
anxiously)
Will you help us? I think something's
wrong out there!
SHERIFF
(after a considerate
pause)
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
LILA
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday.
And no trace until...
SHERIFF
How'd you and this detective come to
trace her to Fairvale?
SAM
They thought she'd be coming to me.
SHERIFF
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
LILA
Yes.
SHERIFF
(a pause)
She ain't missing so much as she's
run away.
SAM
Yes.
SHERIFF
From what?
LILA
(a look at sam, then:)
She stole some money.
SHERIFF
A lot?
LILA
Forty thousand dollars.
SHERIFF
And the police haven't been able
to...
SAM
(interrupting)
Everyone concerned thought... if
they could get her to give back the
money... they could avoid involving
her with the police.
SHERIFF
Explains the private detective. He
traced her to the Bates place. What'd
he exactly say when he called you?
LILA
Mary had been there, one night, and
had left.
SHERIFF
With the forty thousand dollars?
LILA
He didn't mention the money.
(anxiously)
What he said on the phone isn't
important, is it? He was supposed
to come back after he spoke to the
mother, and he didn't! That's what I
want you to do something about!
SHERIFF
Like what?
LILA
Go out there! Find somebody, ask
some questions!
(a pause)
I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to
you. I keep thinking... something's
wrong. I have to know what!
SHERIFF
I think something's wrong, too, Miss.
But not the same thing. I think your
private detective is what's wrong.
(As Lila is about to
object)
I think he got himself a hot lead as
to where your sister was going...
probably from Norman Bates... and
called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.
LILA
He said he was dissatisfied... and
was going back.
MRS. CHAMBERS
(to Sheriff)
Why don't you call Norman and let
him say just what happened, if he
give the man a hot lead and he did
just scooted off... it'll make the
girl feel better, Albert.
SHERIFF
At this hour?
SAM
He was out when I was there. If he's
back he probably isn't even in bed
yet.
SHERIFF
He wasn't out when you were there.
He just wasn't answering the door in
the dead of night... like some people
do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
MRS. CHAMBERS
Recluse. Kinder word.
SHERIFF
(to Sam)
You must remember that bad business
out there. About ten years ago...
SAM
I've only been here five. Right now
it feels like ten, but...
LILA
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Mrs. Chambers goes to phone, dials operator.
MRS. CHAMBERS
(into phone)
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.
She hands the receiver to the Sheriff. He takes it,
reluctantly, listens to the dim sound of RINGING on the other
end. After a moment:
SHERIFF
(into phone)
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.
(listens)
Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we
got some worries here. Did you have
a man stop out there tonight...
(listens)
Well, this one wouldn't be a customer,
anyway. A private detective, name
of...
MRS. CHAMBERS
Arbogast.
SHERIFF
(into phone)
Arbogast.
(listens)
And after he left?
(listens)
No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been
going out there?
(listens)
Well, I think you oughta unload that
place and open up closer in to the
action, a smaller place, you know...
but...
LILA
Please!
SHERIFF
(into phone)
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to
sleep. Yeah, be glad to.
(hangs up, turns to
Mrs. Chambers)
Said to give you his regards.
SAM
(faint irony)
Was that all?
SHERIFF
This detective was out there and
Norman told him about the girl and
the detective thanked him and went
away.
LILA
And he didn't go back? Didn't see
the mother?
The Sheriff looks long at Lila, shakes his head
sympathetically.
SHERIFF
You should've called in the police
the second you found your sister has
skipped. You go starting private
investigations, using people you
don't even know...
LILA
What difference does that...
SHERIFF
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced
lie.
MRS. CHAMBERS
Barefaced.
SHERIFF
He told you he wasn't coming right
back cause he wanted to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?
LILA
Yes.
SHERIFF
(a pause, then calmly)
Norman Bates' mother has been dead
and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for
the last ten years!
There is a long silence. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff.
MRS. CHAMBERS
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
SHERIFF
It ain't only local history, Sam,
it's the only murder-and-suicide
case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs.
Bates poisoned this guy she was...
involved with, when she found out he
was married, then took a helping of
the same stuff herself. Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.
MRS. CHAMBERS
Norman found them dead together. In
bed.
SAM
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Norman Bates'
mother?
MRS. CHAMBERS
(hopefully, happily)
Maybe you saw Mary!
SAM
I'd know the difference between Mary
and an old woman.
SHERIFF
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you
saw an old woman?
SAM
Yes! In the house behind the motel.
I pounded and called but she... just
ignored me.
SHERIFF
And you want to tell me you saw Norman
Bates' mother.
LILA
It must've been. Arbogast said so,
too... and he said the young man
wouldn't let him see her because she
was ill!
The Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks
there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.
SHERIFF
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs.
Bates... who's that woman buried out
at Greenlawn Cemetery?
QUICK CUT TO:
INT. NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)
Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to
him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to
move his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike-
like bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and
resolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he
rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off
the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking
the bird off the shade.
He watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the
floor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at
it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust,
tries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird,
puts it in a drawer. Then he puts out the lamp, goes out,
crosses the darkened office and goes outside.
CUT TO:
EXT. MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)
Norman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly
up to the house, opens the door and goes in.
CUT TO:
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)
SHOOTING UP THE STAIRS
Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door,
then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open.
For a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his
words indistinguishable. Then we hear the cold shot of his
mother's derisive laughter.
MOTHER'S VOICE
I am sorry, boy, but you do manage
to look ludicrous when you give me
orders!
NORMAN'S VOICE
Please, mother...
MOTHER'S VOICE
(Sharp, laughter all
gone)
No! I will not hide in the fruit
cellar!
(A shrill laugh)
Think I'm fruity, huh?
(Hard, cold again)
I'm staying right here! This is my
room and no one will drag me out of
it... least of all my big bold son!
NORMAN'S VOICE
(Rising now, anxiously)
They'll come now, Mother. He came
after the girl and now someone will
come after him! How long do you think
you can go on... Mother, please,
just for a few days, just so they
won't find you!
MOTHER'S VOICE
(Mimicking)
Just for a few days...
(Furious)
In that dank fruit cellar? No! You
hid me there once, boy, and you won't
do it again! Not ever again! Now
get out!
(A pause, quiet)
I told you to get out, boy!
(A longer pause)
Norman! What do you think you're
going to do? Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!
(A pause, then
cajolingly)
All right, son, put me down and I'll
go. I'll go on my own two feet. I
can go on my own two feet, can't I?
During all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the
stairs. It does not stop at the top however, but continues
on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57.
She starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.
NORMAN'S VOICE
I'll carry you, mother.
Norman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms,
her head leaning against his shoulder. He carries her down
the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs,
and then down those stairs to the basement.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)
An overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd. The service is
just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little
I-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as
they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways
away.
Amongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam
and Lila. In their expressions there is no peace, no
contentment. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE. They are not speaking.
Lila looks as if she has had no sleep.
Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward
the church.
CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM, stops as they approach Sheriff and
Mrs. Chambers. The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at
Lila. Mrs. Chambers smiles nicely.
SAM
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd
go out to the motel with you.
MRS. CHAMBERS
He's already been.
SHERIFF
Went out before service.
MRS. CHAMBERS
Have you two had breakfast?
SAM
(To Sheriff, not a
question)
You didn't find anything.
SHERIFF
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
He moves away and the others follow. CAMERA PANS them to the
curb.
LILA
(Interrupting)
Did he say anything about my sister?
SHERIFF
Just what he told your detective.
She used a fake name, saw the register myself. Saw the whole
place, as a matter of fact. That boy is alone there.
SAM
No mother.
SHERIFF
You must've seen an illusion, Sam.
Now, I know you're not the seeing-
illusion type... But no woman was
illusion there and I don't believe
in ghosts, so there it is!
LILA
I still feel...
SHERIFF
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't
make you feel better. You want to
come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person... And the
theft, is what you want to do! Sooner
you drop this thing in the lap of
the law, that's the sooner you'll
stand a chance of your sister bein'
picked up. How about that?
LILA
I don't know.
MRS. CHAMBERS
It's Sunday. Come over and do the
reporting at the house, 'round dinner
time. Make it nicer. You too, Sam.
She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss
this year's charity fandango, takes the
Sheriff's arm, starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes.
Sam and Lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted
chapel. For a long moment they just stand there, their faces
as gray and overcast as the sky.
SAM
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
LILA
You're not.
Sam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward
the spot where his pick-up truck is parked.
CAMERA FOLLOWS them.
SAM
Want me to drop you at the hotel?
Or you want to come over to the store?
Lila does not answer. They reach the truck. Lila looks
directly at Sam as he helps her into the cab.
LILA
I won't feel satisfied unless I got
out there, Sam.
SAM
Neither will I.
He slams the door, hurries around truck, gets into driver's
seat, starts motor. As the truck drives off,
DISSOLVE TO:
SAM AND LILA IN TRUCK - (PROCESS - HIGHWAY)
For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if
there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in
particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.
LILA
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
SAM
Of course we will.
LILA
Alive.
Sam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something
to cheer her. He cannot. He remains silent.
LILA
We lived together all our lives.
When we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans,
Mary quit college and got a job, so I could go to college.
SAM
Where'd you go to college?
LILA
I didn't. I got a job, too.
(A pause)
I wonder if that hurt her, my not
letting her sacrifice for me? Some
people are so willing to suffer for
you that they suffer more if you
don't let them.
SAM
(Almost to himself)
She was willing to lick the stamps.
Lila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue
it.
LILA
I wonder so many things about her
now. Why she never told me about
you... Funny, when you think there's
an answer to everything, you think
you know all the answers.
SAM
We were going to get married. Are
going to get married!
LILA
Do you know how I found out about
you? I found one of your letters...
it was a nice letter, Sam.
SAM
This is the old highway.
LILA
I suppose... when you were able to
marry her she'd have presented you,
all shiny and proper... she always
tried to be proper.
SAM
Watch your tenses.
LILA
Huh?
SAM
She always tries to be proper.
Sam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a
cigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him.
LILA
You going to wait here for me?
SAM
I'm going with you. But we'd better
decide what we're going to say and
do when we walk in...
LILA
We're going to register. As man and
wife. And get shown to a cabin...
and then search every inch of that
place, inside and... outside.
SAM
You won't believe it...
(Starts motor)
But this will be the first time
I've ever pulled one of those man-
and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
LILA
(A tiny smile, first
in hours)
I believe it.
As truck starts to drive on,
CUT TO:
EXT. THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY)
The place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep
gray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning into the
driveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila
get out of the truck.
FRESH ANGLE
Close on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the
truck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in
b.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then
turn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the
window and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door,
peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the
driveway, beside the truck.
CUT TO:
INT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY)
CLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled
the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at
the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is
standing by the truck and looking up at the house. Norman
studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he
closes the curtains, turns away.
We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic
and his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA
remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the
frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel
office and joins Lila.
EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA
SAM
(Unconsciously
whispering)
I wonder where Norman Bates does his
hermiting?
LILA
Someone was at that window. I saw
the curtain move.
Sam takes Lila's arm.
SAM
Come on.
He starts with her toward the path which leads to the old
house. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the
office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward
them. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor
speak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone;
containment and impassivity lie in their place.
SAM
(Cheerfully)
Just coming up to ring for you.
NORMAN
(Coming forward)
I suppose you want a cabin.
SAM
We'd hoped to make it straight to
San Francisco, but we don't like the
look of that sky. Looks like a bad
day coming... doesn't it.
Norman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick,
disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying,
goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow
Norman.
INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to
cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have
entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.
NORMAN
I'll take you to...
SAM
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.
NORMAN
It isn't necessary.
SAM
(Interrupting with a
friendly cheerfulness)
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this
trip... ninety percent business...
and he wants practically notarized
receipts. I better sign in and get a
receipt.
Norman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call
him "liar." Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings
out the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the
book as Sam signs in. Sam signs "Joe and Mrs. Johnson." The
signature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the
notation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrations
above Sam's.
When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman.
Norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.
NORMAN
I'll get your bags.
SAM
Haven't any.
NORMAN
(after a stare)
I'll show you the cabin.
As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns,
looks at him.
SAM
First time I've seen it happen.
(to Lila)
Check in any place in this country
without bags, and you have to pay in
advance.
Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his
pocket.
NORMAN
Ten dollars...
Norman returns to Sam, takes the extended bill, is about to
start out again.
SAM
That receipt...?
Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to
cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under
counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks
up the key, quickly, starts out.
LILA
I'll start ahead.
Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.
EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)
Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries
the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam
and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down
the porch.
SAM
(To Norman, who is
following)
Don't bother yourself... we'll find
it.
He goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one,
walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches
cabin twelve. CAMERA REMAINS with Norman, who is standing by
the office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert
and no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have
closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck.
CAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in
through the driver's window, twists the registration card
around, reads it.
It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis.
Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward
cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are
confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his
face. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the
path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes
in.
INT. CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)
Lila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining
for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from
the window of this cabin.
She turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot
of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased
in a sadness.
LILA
We should have asked for Cabin One...
The one Mary was in.
SAM
I'm glad we didn't.
He pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits
wearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment,
feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge,
turns again and looks at Sam's back.
LILA
We have to go into that cabin and
search it, Sam... no matter what
we're afraid of finding and no matter
how much it may hurt.
SAM
I know.
(A pause)
Do you think if something happened,
it happened there?
LILA
(A pause, then:)
Sam, if you owned a useless business
like this motel... one you probably
couldn't even sell... what would
you need to get away, to start a new
business, somewhere else?
(As Sam studies her)
Forty thousand dollars?
SAM
How could we prove...
(An almost hopeless
laugh)
Well, if he opens a new motel on the
new highway... say, a year from now...
LILA
There must be some proof that exists
right now! Something that proves he
got that money away from Mary...
Some way!
SAM
What makes you sound so certain?
LILA
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or
felt sorry for me... and he was
starting to feel the same about you.
I heard it when he called... in his
voice, a caring. He wouldn't have
gone anywhere or done anything without
telling us. Unless he was stopped.
And he was stopped, so he must have
found out something!
Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.
SAM
We'll start with Cabin One.
He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then,
back to Lila:
SAM
If he sees us... we're just taking
the air.
Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out.
EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)
Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand.
Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin
One. CAMERA FOLLOWS. They pause before the door of Cabin
One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on
to the office, opens the door, calls in:
SAM
Bates?
He waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment
comes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila.
She has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started
to enter.
INT. CABIN ONE - (DAY)
The blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark.
Sam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him.
For a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to
tell them some satisfactory story.
Neither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search,
going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the
closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners,
not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to
find some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The
windowless room is very dark. She switches on the light,
goes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow
her in when he notices which room it is and automatically
catches himself up, backs out.
SAM
Sorry.
LILA
Hospital clean.
SAM
What?
LILA
The bathroom. Look at how clean it
is. The one in our cabin is clean...
but this is clean!
Sam goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the
medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny
tabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the
tub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more
interested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence
he can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower
curtain rod.
And realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about
to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of
shot, interrupts.
Sam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above
the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip
of her right index finger.
SAM
What is it?
LILA
It didn't get washed down. It's
figuring... the kind you tear up and
get rid of.
(Extending her finger
toward Sam)
Some figure has been added to or
subtracted from... forty thousand.
Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it,
takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's
license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet
away.
LILA
That's proof Mary was here! It would
be too wild a coincidence for somebody
else to...
SAM
(Reminding)
Bates never denied Mary was here.
LILA
(Reminded)
Yes.
(A thought)
But maybe this proves that Bates
found out about the money.
SAM
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden
it?
LILA
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is.
I think she told Arbogast something!
And I want her to tell us the same
thing!
She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm,
stops her.
SAM
You can't go up there.
LILA
Why not?
SAM
Bates.
CAMERA STARTS TO PAN AWAY from them, moves slowly over the
room, very slowly.
LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
Let's find him. One of us can keep
him occupied while the other gets to
the woman.
SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
You won't be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held. And I
don't like you going into that house
alone, Lila.
CAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now, and
is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall
paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud.
LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
I can handle a sick old woman.
Now we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is
the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch
Mary. And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now.
SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
All right. I'll find Bates and keep
him occupied.
The eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before
the hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall-hung
painting.
FRESH ANGLE - LILA AND SAM
They are about to start out. Sam stops her again.
SAM
Wait a minute. If you get anything
out of the mother...
(A thought)
Can you find your way back to town?
(As Lila nods yes)
If you do get anything, don't stop
to tell me.
Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first,
opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough
for Lila and Himself to pass through.
EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)
ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her
left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at
the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes
the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside
the open door.
NORMAN
Looking for me?
SAM
(Recovering)
Yes, matter of fact.
(The friendly grin)
The wife's taking a nap and... I can
never keep quiet enough for her...
so I thought I'd look you up and...
talk.
NORMAN
Satisfied with your cabin?
SAM
Fine.
Sam starts into the office. Just before going in, he glances
down the long porch, sees Lila standing outside the door of
cabin twelve, waves her a tiny "all clear" signal.
LILA
CAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her point of view.
She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she
hears the door close, then looks about for another way to
reach the house. She sees the small alley at the end of this
L of cabins, starts toward it.
EXT. REAR OF MOTEL - S.C.U. LILA - (DAY)
Behind the motel Lila hesitates. She looks ahead.
LONG SHOT - (DAY)
The old house standing against the sky.
CLOSE UP - (DAY)
Lila moves forward.
LONG SHOT - (DAY)
The CAMERA approaching the house.
CLOSE UP - (DAY)
Lila glances toward the back of Norman's parlor. She moves
on.
LONG SHOT - (DAY)
The house coming nearer.
CLOSE UP - (DAY)
Lila looks up at the house. She moves forward purposefully.
S.L.S. - (DAY)
The house and the porch.
CLOSE UP - (DAY)
Lila stops at the house and looks up. She glances back.
She turns to the house again.
S.L.S. - (DAY)
The CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch.
C.U. - (DAY)
Lila puts out her hand.
S.C.U. - (DAY)
Lila's hand pushes the door open. We see the hallway.
Lila ENTERS PAST CAMERA.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
Lila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet,
listening. Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which
leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and
the parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the
kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent.
She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares
at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor.
She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor
and dining room.
INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
Norman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who
is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Norman has the look of
one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a
protective wall against the threatening world across it.
SAM
(Cheerfully, as if
after a self-conscious
pause)
I've been doing all the talking so
far, haven't I?
NORMAN
Yes.
SAM
I always thought it was the people
who are alone so much who do all the
talking when they get the chance.
Yet there you are, doing all the
listening!
(A pause)
You are alone here, aren't you?
(As Norman does not
reply)
It would drive me crazy.
NORMAN
That would be a rather extreme
reaction, wouldn't it?
SAM
(Lightly)
Just an expression...
(More seriously)
What I meant was... I'd do just about
anything... to get away. Wouldn't
you?
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
Lila is halfway up the stairs. As she climbs she is startled
by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She
steps more carefully. CAMERA remains at foot of stair, TILTING
UP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The
door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is
closed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly
before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment,
trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on
the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door,
the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly.
INT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR
We hear Lila's second knock, then, faintly, her soft call.
LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
Mrs. Bates?
There is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open,
and we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at
the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her
expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go
away from this room forever.
After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind
her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as
Lila sees it.
It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe,
an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of
the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the
dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a
great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full-
length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite
the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the
window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled
with ashes.
And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if
even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long
vacated by some musty presence.
Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over
it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on
it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-
like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes
to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and
jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an
opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of
hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of
herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to
the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high
wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it,
hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed
dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters
and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-
type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.
Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished
shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once
again over the whole room, starts out,
INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind
her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to
the room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark,
the shades drawn full.
Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall,
throws on a switch.
INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
Sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.
SAM
I'm not saying you shouldn't be
contented here, I'm just doubting
that you are. I think if you saw a
chance to get out from under...
you'd unload this place...
NORMAN
(Angrily)
This place! This isn't 'a place.'
It's my only world. I grew up in
that house back there. I was a happy
child. My mother and I... we were
more than happy.
SAM
And now that your mother's dead?
Norman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him.
NORMAN
My mother is not dead!
SAM
(Softly)
I didn't think so.
INT. NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick
dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy
of childhood held beyond the point of decency.
It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping
silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and
fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far
too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled
covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.
Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top
there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an
ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's
shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.
Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled
with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white
chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record
on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be
Beethoven's Eroica Symphony.
Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances
at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase
and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens
it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust.
She slams the book closed, drops it.
INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
Norman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall.
Sam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning
forward, his eyes hard on Norman's face.
Norman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark,
high sheen of a cornered animal.
SAM
(Pressing)
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?
NORMAN
I don't know what you've been saying.
SAM
I've been talking about your mother...
about your motel. How are you going
to do it?
NORMAN
Do what?
SAM
Buy a new one! In a new town!
Where you won't have to hide your
mother!
NORMAN
Shut up!
SAM
Where will you get the money to do
that, Bates... or do you already
have it... socked away... a lot of
it...
NORMAN
Leave me alone!
SAM
...Forty thousand dollars!
NORMAN
Leave me alone!
He is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back
into his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter,
follows.
INT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)
Norman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached
by this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear
window, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses.
Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away
as are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief
flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to
gaze at Norman, hard.
SAM
I bet your mother knows where the
money is. And what you did to get
it. And I think she'll tell us.
Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives
Norman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances
out the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and
there is terror in his voice.
NORMAN
Where's that girl? The girl you came
with! Where is she?
Sam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine
a stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.
NORMAN
(A horrible groan)
Oh, God!
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
Lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out
of Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in
the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite
the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the
bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.
INT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)
Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A
candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking
as if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's
footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse
of him going out into the office, almost at a run.
INT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
Lila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA.
She is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound
she might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down
the stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the
front door, sees out through the door window:
LILA'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)
Norman coming.
INT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps,
cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the
stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The
SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard.
Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the
basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching
there.
Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens.
He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He
seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes
from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time
state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.
Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to
the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed
by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an
upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs
for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the
steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is
caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses,
looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the
not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving
SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.
Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while
she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check
that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she
desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what
happened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly down
the stairs.
INT. THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
Lila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards
creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them. She
turns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in. The woman
is sitting in a comfortable chair, the back of the chair,
and the woman, turned to the door. Lila calls a harsh,
frightened whisper.
LILA
Mrs. Bates...?
Lila goes into the room.
INT. THE FRUIT CELLAR
Lila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the
figure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise
movement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a
woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the
mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.
The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose
has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are
sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and
flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed
dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.
The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning
as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually
graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.
Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins
to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.
And Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more
dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind
her.
NORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
(screaming)
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma
Bates!
Lila turns.
NORMAN
His face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a
woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is
similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand
is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long
breadknife in it.
LILA
Close on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming.
BACK TO NORMAN
As he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in
from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes
through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling
back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman,
football tackle style.
SERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT
Norman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face,
the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified,
fight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila.
MRS. BATES
A close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying
the fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the
screams of Norman.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)
There are many people gathered about the steps, the curious
and the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of
newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit
truck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and
chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the
sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being
moved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and
the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back.
The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden
light thrown on a fearful darkness.
CLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE
A POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men,
muttering "keep back," etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION
MAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and
CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule.
Here, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters,
Television Men. The Television Men we have been following
stops beside a Policeman.
TELEVISION MAN
(Indicating the front
door he has just
come in through)
You think they'll take him out that
way?
POLICEMAN
(Looking at waiting
crowd, shrugging)
Probably have to.
(A rueful smile)
Besides, the taxpayers hate it when
something gets slipped out the back
door on them!
Over this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement
of men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door
of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow
with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-
for coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY
pauses a moment, then goes into the room.
CUT TO:
INT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)
Lila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart
from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with
the CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT
ATTORNEY.
The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes
a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila,
checking the notation on the lid as he goes.
MED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA
SAM
(quietly)
It's regular. Okay?
LILA
(ruefully)
I could stand something regular.
Sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff
Chambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has
brought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you.
For a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam
disheveled, but contained.
CHAMBERS
You two can go on home if you like.
(a sympathetic look
at Lila)
Making that statement was enough for
one night.
SAM
(to Lila)
Want to?
LILA
No. I'm all right. I'll feel better
when all this is explained... if it
can be.
Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs
doubtfully.
CHAMBERS
If anybody gets any answers, it'll
be the fellow talking to him now...
the Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't
reach Norman... and he knows me.
(to Lila)
You warm enough, Miss?
Lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the
room and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn,
follow her gaze.
INT. OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT
A young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into
the room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist.
He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has
been placed, takes up a container.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Did he talk to you?
SIMON
No. I got the whole story... but not
from Norman. I got it from... his
mother.
Everyone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes
lid from coffee container.
SIMON
Norman Bates no longer exists. He
only half-existed to begin with...
now, the other half has taken over.
Probably for all time.
LILA
(With difficulty)
Did he kill my sister?
SIMON
Yes... and no.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Look, if you're trying to lay a lot
of psychiatric groundwork for some
sort of plea this fellow would like
to cop...
SIMON
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the
groundwork .. he merely tries to
explain it.
LILA
But my sister is...
SIMON
Yes. I'm sorry.
(to Chambers)
The Private Investigator, too. If
you drag that swamp somewhere in the
vicinity of the motel...
(To the Chief of Police)
Have you any unsolved missing persons
cases on your books?
CHIEF OF POLICE
Yes. Two.
SIMON
Young girls?
CHIEF OF POLICE
(nods, astounded,
then:)
Did he confess to...
SIMON
(interrupting)
As I said, the mother...
(Pauses, goes on afresh)
To understand it, as I understood it
hearing it from the mother... That
is, from the mother-half of Norman's
mind, you have to go back ten years...
to the time when Norman murdered his
mother and her lover.
(A pause, then as no
one interrupts)
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.
His mother was a clinging, demanding
woman... and for years the two of
them lived as if there was no one
else in the world. Then she met a
man and it seemed to Norman she "threw
him over" for this man. That pushed
him over the thin line... and he
killed them both. Matricide is
probably the most unbearable crime
of all... and most unbearable to the
son who commit it. So he had to erase
the crime, at least in his own mind.
(A pause)
He stole her corpse... and a weighted
coffin was buried. He hid the body
in the fruit cellar, even "treated"
it to keep it as well as it would
keep. And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.
So he began to think and speak for
her, gave her half his life, so to
speak. At times he could be both
personalities, carry on
conversations... at other times, the
mother-half took over completely. He
was never all Norman, but he was
often only mother. And because he
was so pathologically jealous of
her, he assumed she was as jealous
of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman, the
mother side of him would go wild.
(To Lila)
When Norman met your sister, he was
touched by her... and aroused by
her. He wanted her. And this set off
his "jealous mother" and... "mother
killed the girl." After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep
sleep... and like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime
he was convinced his mother had
committed.
SAM
Why was he... dressed like that?
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
He's a transvestite!
SIMON
Not exactly. A man who dresses in
woman's clothing in order to achieve
a sexual change... or satisfaction...
is a transvestite. But in Norman's
case, he was simply doing everything
possible to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive. And
whenever reality came too close,
when danger or desire threatened
that illusion, he'd dress up, even
to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd
walk about the house, sit in her
chair, speak in her voice... He tried
to be his mother.
(A sad smile)
And now he is.
(A pause)
That's what I meant when I said I
got the story from the mother. She
thinks Norman has been taken away...
because of his crimes. She insists
she did nothing, that Norman committed
all the murders just to keep her
from being discovered. She even smiled
a bit coquettishly as she said that.
Of course, she feels badly about
it... but also somewhat relieved to
be, as she put it, free of Norman,
at last.
(A pause)
When the mind houses two
personalities, there is always a
battle. In Norman's case, the battle
is over... and the dominant
personality has won.
Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for
Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world.
Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.
CHAMBERS
(To Simon)
And the forty thousand dollars? Who
got that?
SIMON
The swamp. These were murders of
passion, not profit.
A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-
whisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a
folded blanket over his arm.
POLICE GUARD
He feels a little chill... can I
bring him this blanket?
The Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA
FOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway. Guard
moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.
CUT TO:
INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE
A narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of
shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered
glass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking
reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance
into the room.
The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this
corridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed
Guard opens the door, allows the man to go in.
Shot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room.
After a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard
closes and locks the door and we
CUT TO:
INT. NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)
The walls are white and plain. There is no window.
There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which
Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality
of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.
The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding
it. His face, although without makeup and without the
surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity
about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch
womanliness about the brows.
Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if
it were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so
that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in
position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the
voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.
MOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
It's sad... when a mother has to
speak the words that condemn her own
son... but I couldn't allow them to
believe that I would commit murder.
(A pause)
They'll put him away now... as I
should have... years ago. He was
always... bad. And in the end, he
intended to tell them I killed those
girls... and that man. As if I could
do anything except just sit and
stare... like one of his stuffed
birds.
(A pause)
Well, they know I can't even move a
finger. And I won't. I'll just sit
here and be quiet. Just in case they
do... suspect me.
A fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying
about Norman's face.
MOTHER'S VOICE (V.O.)
They're probably watching me. Well,
let them. Let them see what kind of
a person I am.
(A pause, as the fly
lights on Norman's
hand)
I'm not going to swat that fly. I
hope they are watching. They'll see...
they'll see... and they'll know...
and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't
even harm a fly...'
Norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing.
SCENE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:
THE SWAMP
As END TITLES FADE IN, we see the swamp, the chain of a tow-
truck. The chain is attached to Mary's car. The car is coming
out of the swamp.
FADE OUT
THE END
